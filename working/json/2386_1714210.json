This affecting and naturalistic romance is beautifully realized, earning comparisons to Richard Linklater's Before Sunrise in its exploration of how two people can come together only briefly, yet impact each other in a profound way. -- (C) Sundance Selects","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Na1llp3Bwojrgl-Cq-rTgrmLtVA=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/93/11159311_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Na1llp3Bwojrgl-Cq-rTgrmLtVA=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/93/11159311_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Na1llp3Bwojrgl-Cq-rTgrmLtVA=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/93/11159311_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Na1llp3Bwojrgl-Cq-rTgrmLtVA=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/93/11159311_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Tom Cullen","id":"771099345","characters":["Russell"]},{"name":"Chris New","id":"771099346","characters":["Glen"]},{"name":"Jonathan Race","id":"771381038","characters":["Jamie"]},{"name":"Laura Freeman","id":"771381039","characters":["Jill"]},{"name":"Johnny Wright","id":"770914648","characters":["Johnny"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Andrew Haigh"}],"studio":"IFC Films","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1714210"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1714210","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/weekend_2011/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771235363/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771235363/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771235363/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771235363.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
