Jo (Emma Roberts, Cassandra (Tasmin Egerton), Kerrys (Shanika Warren-Markland) and Shannon (Ophelia Lovibond) used to be inseparable, but lately they've begun to grow apart. As Jo struggles for a sense of direction while earning a meager income in a sterlile supermarket, Cassandra races off to New York for a fling with a guy she met online, militant feminist Kerrys wages an unrelenting war against a male dominated society, and Shannon falls into a treacherous, self-destructive tailspin. But just when it seemed as if these old friends were headed down different paths, a brazen crime thrusts them back together for an exhilarating adventure that will prove just how unpredictable life can really be. Sean Pertwee and Kevin Smith co-star. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3innKhcJkt9Hy7yDR4-bAX_w9ts=/54x74/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/60/11166093_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3innKhcJkt9Hy7yDR4-bAX_w9ts=/54x74/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/60/11166093_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3innKhcJkt9Hy7yDR4-bAX_w9ts=/54x74/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/60/11166093_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3innKhcJkt9Hy7yDR4-bAX_w9ts=/54x74/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/60/11166093_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Emma Roberts","id":"326298386","characters":["Joanne"]},{"name":"Ophelia Lovibond","id":"770838549","characters":["Shannon"]},{"name":"Sean Pertwee","id":"162716856","characters":["Mr. Richards"]},{"name":"Tamsin Egerton","id":"326390750","characters":["Cassandra"]},{"name":"Shanika Warren-Markland","id":"770822903","characters":["Kerrys"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Noel Clarke"},{"name":"Mark Davis"}],"studio":"Unstoppable Entertainment","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1514041"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1514041","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/4321/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771036867/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771036867/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771036867/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771036867.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
