When corporate downsizing leaves him and co-workers Phil Woodward (Chris Cooper) and Gene McClary (Tommy Lee Jones) jobless, the three men are forced to re-define their lives as men, husbands, and fathers. <br /><br /> Bobby soon finds himself enduring enthusiastic life coaching, a job building houses for his brother-in-law (Kevin Costner) which does not play to his executive skill set, and perhaps the realization that there is more to life than chasing the bigger, better deal. With humor, pathos, and keen observation, writer-director John Wells (the creator of \"ER\") introduces us to the new realities of American life. -- (C) Weinstein","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/O11NzpfXDr5zIq5Reg_YAmOZJ4Y=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/31/11153150_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/O11NzpfXDr5zIq5Reg_YAmOZJ4Y=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/31/11153150_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/O11NzpfXDr5zIq5Reg_YAmOZJ4Y=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/31/11153150_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/O11NzpfXDr5zIq5Reg_YAmOZJ4Y=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/31/11153150_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Tommy Lee Jones","id":"162666788","characters":["Gene McClary"]},{"name":"Ben Affleck","id":"162665891","characters":["Bobby Walker"]},{"name":"Chris Cooper","id":"162654289","characters":["Phil Woodward"]},{"name":"Maria Bello","id":"162654542","characters":["Sally Wilcox"]},{"name":"Rosemarie DeWitt","id":"356196984","characters":["Maggie Walker"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"John Wells"}],"studio":"The Weinstein Company","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1172991"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1172991","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the-company-men/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770820081/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770820081/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770820081/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770820081.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
