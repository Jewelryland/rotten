The film opens with two teenagers flying from New York to Los Angeles on New Years Eve. Their nightmare begins when their plane hits extreme turbulence mid-flight. The relentless weather attack causes panic and terror amongst the passengers until the plane ultimately crashes in a remote government-testing area. The handful of survivors from the crash, bloody and disoriented, are then insistently pursued in the darkness by unknown predators that, unbeknownst to them, are part of the government's top-secret Mesa Experiment. The film will take moviegoers on a whirlwind ride, with a twist ending that will leave you breathless, shocked, and terrified. -- (C) Official Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/MdSTn4_ogeblq4wgkA15GvnCKug=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/45/11164532_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/MdSTn4_ogeblq4wgkA15GvnCKug=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/45/11164532_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/MdSTn4_ogeblq4wgkA15GvnCKug=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/45/11164532_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/MdSTn4_ogeblq4wgkA15GvnCKug=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/45/11164532_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Abigail Schrader","id":"771384750","characters":["Trish"]},{"name":"Samantha Lester","id":"771384751","characters":["Jessie"]},{"name":"James Lyons","id":"770749609","characters":["Jimmy"]},{"name":"Melanie Lyons","id":"771384752","characters":["Laura"]},{"name":"Brendan Patrick Connor","id":"771386389","characters":["Charlie"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Dale Fabriger"},{"name":"Dale Fabrigar"}],"studio":"IFC Midnight","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"2062661"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=2062661","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/area_407/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771257299/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771257299/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771257299/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771257299.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
