But behind the gilded walls of his mansion, Miller is in over his head, desperately trying to complete the sale of his trading empire to a major bank before the depths of his fraud are revealed. Struggling to conceal his duplicity from loyal wife Ellen (Susan Sarandon) and brilliant daughter and heir-apparent Brooke (Brit Marling), Miller's also balancing an affair with French art-dealer Julie Cote (Laetetia Casta). Just as he's about to unload his troubled empire, an unexpected bloody error forces him to juggle family, business, and crime with the aid of Jimmy Grant (Nate Parker), a face from Miller's past. -- (C) Official Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/le5k13vcg8eVZBjdfUUWc99MbHg=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/57/11165790_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/le5k13vcg8eVZBjdfUUWc99MbHg=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/57/11165790_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/le5k13vcg8eVZBjdfUUWc99MbHg=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/57/11165790_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/le5k13vcg8eVZBjdfUUWc99MbHg=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/57/11165790_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Susan Sarandon","id":"162654579","characters":["Ellen Miller"]},{"name":"Richard Gere","id":"162655185","characters":["Robert Miller"]},{"name":"Tim Roth","id":"162652856","characters":["Det.
