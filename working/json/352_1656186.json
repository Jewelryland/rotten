Upon his release he's ready to leave his criminal past behind and try to rebuild a relationship with his estranged daughter Allison. The FBI and his old cohorts believe that he hid the loot from the last heist 8 years ago, $10 Million in Bonds. To get his hands on it, his old partner Vincent kidnaps Allison and demands the entire $ 10 Million as ransom. Montgomery only has one day to get the $10 Million ransom but much to the disbelief of the FBI on his trail and Vincent, Will doesn't actually have it. Instead, he must trust his instincts and his old partner in crime, the beautiful, sexy and smart Riley, to do one more, clever heist to get his daughter back alive before it's too late. -- (C) Official Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/iMdFiJyNV5xQSJNebuh8i1pqcok=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/16/11171698_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/iMdFiJyNV5xQSJNebuh8i1pqcok=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/16/11171698_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/iMdFiJyNV5xQSJNebuh8i1pqcok=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/16/11171698_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/iMdFiJyNV5xQSJNebuh8i1pqcok=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/16/11171698_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Nicolas Cage","id":"162653923","characters":["Will Montgomery"]},{"name":"Josh Lucas","id":"162652973","characters":["Vincent"]},{"name":"Danny Huston","id":"162653683","characters":["Tim Harlend"]},{"name":"Malin Akerman","id":"512896981","characters":["Riley Jeffers"]},{"name":"Sami Gayle","id":"771398411","characters":["Alison Loeb"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Simon West"}],"studio":"Millennium Entertainment","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1656186"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1656186","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/stolen_2012/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771309696/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771309696/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771309696/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771309696.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
