This all changes, however, on Christmas Eve, when a mysterious train visits Billy in the middle of the night, promising to take him and a group of other lucky children to the North Pole for a visit with Santa. The train's conductor (Tom Hanks) along with the other passengers help turn Billy's crisis in faith into a journey of self-discovery. A long-time fan of Van Allsburg's book, Hanks also helped produce the film. ~ Tracie Cooper, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/mSa7APdTQttOB0Ow5eyS8gGKucM=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/55/35/36/5535368_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/mSa7APdTQttOB0Ow5eyS8gGKucM=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/55/35/36/5535368_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/mSa7APdTQttOB0Ow5eyS8gGKucM=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/55/35/36/5535368_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/mSa7APdTQttOB0Ow5eyS8gGKucM=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/55/35/36/5535368_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Tom Hanks","id":"162655641","characters":["Hero Boy/Father/Conductor/Hobo/Scrooge/Santa"]},{"name":"Daryl Sabara","id":"162662386","characters":["Hero Boy"]},{"name":"Leslie Zemeckis","id":"770922087","characters":["Sister Sarah/Mother"]},{"name":"Michael Jeter","id":"162655642","characters":["Smokey/Steamer"]},{"name":"Steven Tyler","id":"410603007","characters":["Elf Singer"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Robert Zemeckis"}],"studio":"Warner Bros.
