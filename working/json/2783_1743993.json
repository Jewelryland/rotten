As you watch this film there is one inescapable fact that cannot be denied, one fact that will make your blood run cold, one fact that will leave you gasping for breath and unable to turn out the lights...everything you are about to see..really happened. Yorkshire, 1974, the Maynard family moves into their dream house. It's a dream that quickly descends into a panic stricken nightmare as the family discovers a horrifying truth, a truth that will make the historybooks. The house is already occupied by the most violent poltergeist ever documented, a poltergeist that will tear you from your bed as you sleep anddrag you helplessly into the darkness. As the attacks on the family become increasingly violent and terrifying it becomes clear that the exorcism of the poltergeist will be their only chance for survival. Two separate exorcism are attempted...the consequences of which..are disastrous. When The Lights Went Out is based on true events that occurred at No. 30, East Drive on the Chesterfield Estate, Pontefract, WestYorkshire. The subject of a plethora of research group studies, books and newspaper reports, this is the horrifying story of what really happened. Embrace the truth and experience unrivalled terror.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://d3biamo577v4eu.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/poster_default_thumb.gif","profile":"http://d3biamo577v4eu.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/poster_default_thumb.gif","detailed":"http://d3biamo577v4eu.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/poster_default_thumb.gif","original":"http://d3biamo577v4eu.cloudfront.net/static/images/redesign/poster_default_thumb.gif"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Kate Ashfield","id":"162684058","characters":["Jenny"]},{"name":"Steve Waddinton","id":"771546804","characters":["Len"]},{"name":"Tasha Connor","id":"771396117","characters":["Sally Maynard"]},{"name":"Craig Parkinson","id":"770673829","characters":["Brian"]},{"name":"Jo Hartley","id":"566051914","characters":["Jeanette"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Pat Holden"}],"studio":"Revolver Entertainment","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1743993"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1743993","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/when_the_lights_went_out/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771268727/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771268727/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771268727/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771268727.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
