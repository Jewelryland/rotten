The people of Earth are desperate to escape the planet's crime and poverty, and they critically need the state-of-the-art medical care available on Elysium - but some in Elysium will stop at nothing to enforce anti-immigration laws and preserve their citizens' luxurious lifestyle. The only man with the chance bring equality to these worlds is Max (Matt Damon), an ordinary guy in desperate need to get to Elysium. With his life hanging in the balance, he reluctantly takes on a dangerous mission - one that pits him against Elysium's Secretary Delacourt (Jodie Foster) and her hard-line forces - but if he succeeds, he could save not only his own life, but millions of people on Earth as well. -- (C) Sony","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3NGAIXFjEmIlcIY1y4Qqa46a_PI=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/52/11175291_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3NGAIXFjEmIlcIY1y4Qqa46a_PI=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/52/11175291_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3NGAIXFjEmIlcIY1y4Qqa46a_PI=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/52/11175291_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3NGAIXFjEmIlcIY1y4Qqa46a_PI=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/52/11175291_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Matt Damon","id":"162653499","characters":["Max Da Costa"]},{"name":"Jodie Foster","id":"162654080","characters":["Secretary Delacourt"]},{"name":"Sharlto Copley","id":"770674319","characters":["Kruger"]},{"name":"Alice Braga","id":"326394052","characters":["Frey"]},{"name":"Diego Luna","id":"162663833","characters":["Julio"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Neill Blomkamp"}],"studio":"TriStar Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1535108"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1535108","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/elysium_2013/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771235149/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771235149/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771235149/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771235149.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
