Tom takes on the case in an attempt to find absolution, and a second tale evolves, set 50 before, involving a man named Matthew Wakefield (Josh Lucas) and his son John. The baffling similarities between the Wakefield case and Tommy Jr.'s mysterious fate push Tom to the brink of sanity and ultimately lead him on a collision course with fate. Gradually, one step at a time, Tom stumbles onto the horrifying truth about what happened to his boy. ~ Nathan Southern, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/CDeZUpOMMmQQ8__gTyj5oZl2PvQ=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/90/11169078_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/CDeZUpOMMmQQ8__gTyj5oZl2PvQ=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/90/11169078_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/CDeZUpOMMmQQ8__gTyj5oZl2PvQ=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/90/11169078_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/CDeZUpOMMmQQ8__gTyj5oZl2PvQ=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/90/11169078_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Jon Hamm","id":"770696952","characters":["Tom Adkins Sr."]},{"name":"Josh Lucas","id":"162652973","characters":["Matthew Wakefield"]},{"name":"James Van Der Beek","id":"162678054","characters":["Diploma/Roggiani"]},{"name":"Jessica Chastain","id":"770760183","characters":["Sally Ann"]},{"name":"Jimmy Bennett","id":"162652369","characters":["John Wakefield"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Anders Anderson"}],"studio":"IFC Films","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1139282"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1139282","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10012207-stolen/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770814671/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770814671/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770814671/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770814671.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
