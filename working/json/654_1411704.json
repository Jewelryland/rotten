But while EB (Russell Brand) is the next in line to receive the official title, he couldn't care less about becoming the official bearer of chocolate eggs and jellybeans. Escaping to Hollywood in a bid to find fame and fortune, EB hops in front of an oncoming car driven by Fred (James Marsden), who agrees to give him a place to recover until he's healthy enough to hop along home. Now, the harder Fred struggles to stop his furry new companion from sending his life into a tailspin, the more satisfaction he begins to get out of his newfound responsibility. With a little luck and a whole lot of patience, Fred just might become the man who saved Easter for everyone. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/LihWB5DTa4d3-QuSvmcyuH-fv_Q=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/37/11163776_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/LihWB5DTa4d3-QuSvmcyuH-fv_Q=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/37/11163776_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/LihWB5DTa4d3-QuSvmcyuH-fv_Q=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/37/11163776_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/LihWB5DTa4d3-QuSvmcyuH-fv_Q=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/37/11163776_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"James Marsden","id":"162684857","characters":["Fred O'Hare"]},{"name":"Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting","id":"771514334","characters":["Sam O'Hare"]},{"name":"Gary Cole","id":"162678007","characters":["Henry O'Hare"]},{"name":"Elizabeth Perkins","id":"162652928","characters":["Bonnie O'Hare"]},{"name":"David Hasselhoff","id":"326299610","characters":["Himself"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Tim Hill"}],"studio":"Universal Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1411704"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1411704","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hop_2011/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770858014/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770858014/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770858014/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770858014.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
