Clay (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), Jensen (Chris Evans), Roque (Idris Elba), Pooch (Columbus Short), and Cougar (Oscar Jaenada) were on a black-ops mission in the Bolivian jungle when rogue CIA agent Max (Jason Patric) hung them out to dry. After beating the odds and surviving their ordeal, the team decides to strike back against Max even if it means sacrificing their own lives to do so. Aiding them on their treacherous suicide mission is sexy operative Aisha (Zoe Saldana), who has her own reasons for wanting to see Max get his just deserts. But getting to Max won't be easy, because in addition to having the CIA on his side, he's about to spark a war that could plunge the entire globe into chaos. Their time quickly running out as Max's plan kicks into overdrive, the Special Forces unit that everyone assumed dead arms themselves to the teeth and prepares to strike back with a vengeance. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/00/11170062_tmb.jpg","profile":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/00/11170062_tmb.jpg","detailed":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/00/11170062_tmb.jpg","original":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/17/00/11170062_tmb.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Jeffrey Dean Morgan","id":"770674876","characters":["Clay"]},{"name":"Zoe Saldana","id":"162660050","characters":["Aisha"]},{"name":"Chris Evans","id":"162652784","characters":["Jensen"]},{"name":"Idris Elba","id":"162654425","characters":["Roque"]},{"name":"Columbus Short","id":"364478848","characters":["Pooch"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Sylvain White"}],"studio":"Warner Bros.
