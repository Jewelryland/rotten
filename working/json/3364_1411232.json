Starring Tom Felton (Harry Potter), Gemma Atkinson (Hollyoaks), Isabella Calthorpe (How to Lose Friends and Alienate People) and Joshua Bowman (Holby City). A full moon hangs in the night sky and lightning streaks across dark storm clouds. Sarah Tyler (Isabella Calthorpe) returns to her troubled family home in the isolated countryside, for a much put-off visit. As the storm rages on, Sarah, along with her family and friends shore up for the night, cut off from the outside world. But something emerges from the driving rain and darkness. Something that holds a dark secret so devastating that, in one night, it could wipe out the entire family. Trapped, Sarah, along with her brothers and friends must use their heads as well as their physical strength to survive not only the thing that is hunting them down one by one - but their own entrapment as the besieged group turns in on itself. Can they survive the horror which is stalking them? Can they survive for 13 hours? Or is their enemy already amongst them and always has been?","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/OMlJ_DU9tgb6yT12LaujH0_4BQs=/54x73/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/82/11158258_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/OMlJ_DU9tgb6yT12LaujH0_4BQs=/54x73/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/82/11158258_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/OMlJ_DU9tgb6yT12LaujH0_4BQs=/54x73/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/82/11158258_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/OMlJ_DU9tgb6yT12LaujH0_4BQs=/54x73/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/82/11158258_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Gemma Atkinson","id":"770838973"},{"name":"Joshua Bowman","id":"771080142"},{"name":"Isabella Calthorpe","id":"771029200"}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Jonathan Glendening"}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1411232"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1411232","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/13hrs/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771207917/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771207917/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771207917/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771207917.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
