Anderson uses the 3D technology pioneered by James Cameron and Vincent Pace to take movie lovers on a nightmare thrill-ride. It's been five years since the zombie virus swept across the globe, and Alice (Milla Jovovich) is still traveling tirelessly in search of survivors. When the Umbrella Corporation ratchets up the stakes, an old friend turns up to lend Alice a helping hand. Rumor has it that some survivors have found sanctuary in Los Angeles, but when Alice and friends show up they find the city overrun with zombies, and quickly realize they've stumbled into a diabolical trap. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/COSkW8mqFfHOzLRP7W6mvR6trfo=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/98/11169878_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/COSkW8mqFfHOzLRP7W6mvR6trfo=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/98/11169878_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/COSkW8mqFfHOzLRP7W6mvR6trfo=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/98/11169878_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/COSkW8mqFfHOzLRP7W6mvR6trfo=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/98/11169878_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Milla Jovovich","id":"162664693","characters":["Alice"]},{"name":"Ali Larter","id":"162688481","characters":["Claire Redfield"]},{"name":"Kim Coates","id":"186021584","characters":["Bennett"]},{"name":"Shawn Roberts","id":"410722792","characters":["Albert Wesker"]},{"name":"Sergio Peris-Mencheta","id":"768231180","characters":["Angel"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Paul W.S.
