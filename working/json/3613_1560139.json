Inspired by the Oscar nominated Two Cars, One Night, Boy is the hilarious and heartfelt coming-of-age tale about heroes, magic and Michael Jackson. Boy is a dreamer who loves Michael Jackson. He lives with his brother Rocky, a tribe of deserted cousins and his Nan. Boy's other hero, his father, Alamein, is the subject of Boy's fantasies, and he imagines him as a deep sea diver, war hero and a close relation of Michael Jackson (he can even dance like him). In reality he's \"in the can for robbery\". When Alamein returns home after 7 years away, Boy is forced to confront the man he thought he remembered, find his own potential and learn to get along without the hero he had been hoping for. -- (C) Official Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/yJWT8uIUdhz3XrUs8u6_WxmaKc8=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/35/11163571_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/yJWT8uIUdhz3XrUs8u6_WxmaKc8=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/35/11163571_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/yJWT8uIUdhz3XrUs8u6_WxmaKc8=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/35/11163571_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/yJWT8uIUdhz3XrUs8u6_WxmaKc8=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/35/11163571_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"James Rolleston","id":"770873093","characters":["Boy"]},{"name":"Te Aho Eketone-Whitu","id":"770873095","characters":["Rocky"]},{"name":"Taika Waititi","id":"770902311","characters":["Alamein"]},{"name":"Rajvinder Eria","id":"771395823","characters":["Tane"]},{"name":"Moerangi Tihore","id":"771073928","characters":["Dynasty"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Taika Waititi"},{"name":"Topaz Adizes"}],"studio":"Paladin Films","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1560139"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1560139","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/boy_2012/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771257749/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771257749/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771257749/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771257749.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
