Whannell plays Adam, one of two men chained up in a mysterious chamber. The other, Dr. Gordon (Cary Elwes), like Adam, has no idea how either of them got there. Neither of them are led to feel optimistic by the man lying between them dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Together, Adam and Dr. Gordon attempt to piece together what has happened to them and who the sadistic madman behind their imprisonment is. Also starring Danny Glover and Monica Potter, Saw premiered at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival. ~ Matthew Tobey, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/5eFsn1TQvv4L6WrKRgk-9Suv5wA=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/76/11177636_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/5eFsn1TQvv4L6WrKRgk-9Suv5wA=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/76/11177636_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/5eFsn1TQvv4L6WrKRgk-9Suv5wA=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/76/11177636_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/5eFsn1TQvv4L6WrKRgk-9Suv5wA=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/76/11177636_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Leigh Whannell","id":"364604347","characters":["Adam"]},{"name":"Cary Elwes","id":"162657306","characters":["Dr. Lawrence Gordon"]},{"name":"Danny Glover","id":"162660485","characters":["Detective David Tapp"]},{"name":"Ken Leung","id":"528393137","characters":["Detective Steven Sing"]},{"name":"Dina Meyer","id":"162674020","characters":["Kerry"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"James Wan"}],"studio":"Lions Gate Films","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"0387564"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=0387564","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/saw/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/16980/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/16980/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/16980/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/16980.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
