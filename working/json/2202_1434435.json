After a bank robbery gone wrong, three brothers go home to hideout...only to discover that their Mother (Rebecca De Mornay) lost their house in a foreclosure. The new owners and their party guests become the depraved brothers' unwitting hostages. Their sadistic Mother soon arrives and brilliantly takes control of the situation, ratcheting up the terror. As the hostages struggle desperately to survive the harrowing torture, they realize that there is nothing a Mother won't do to protect her children. -- (C) Anchor Bay","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/NrRVKGWMz4VlPRBfUY03kUhoP_s=/54x76/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/42/11164243_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/NrRVKGWMz4VlPRBfUY03kUhoP_s=/54x76/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/42/11164243_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/NrRVKGWMz4VlPRBfUY03kUhoP_s=/54x76/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/42/11164243_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/NrRVKGWMz4VlPRBfUY03kUhoP_s=/54x76/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/42/11164243_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Jaime King","id":"162670080","characters":["Beth Sohapi"]},{"name":"Patrick Flueger","id":"770674185","characters":["Ike Koffin"]},{"name":"Rebecca De Mornay","id":"162662532","characters":["Mother"]},{"name":"Warren Kole","id":"770688533","characters":["Addley Koffin"]},{"name":"Deborah Ann Woll","id":"770857019","characters":["Lydia Koffin"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Darren Lynn Bousman"}],"studio":"Anchor Bay Entertainment","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1434435"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1434435","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mothers-day/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770818652/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770818652/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770818652/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770818652.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
