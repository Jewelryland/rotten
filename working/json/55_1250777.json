Comic book geek Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) may not have good coordination or special powers, but that doesn't mean he isn't a fully capable crime fighter. After purchasing a flashy wet suit on the Internet, Dave starts busting up baddies with nothing but brute force. He calls himself Kick-Ass, and he can take a beating as good as he can dish one out. Before long, Kick-Ass has become a local sensation, and others are following his lead. Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and Hit-Girl (Chloe Moretz) are a father-daughter crime-fighting duo who have set their sights on local mob heavy Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong). They're doing a decent job of dismantling Frank's sizable underworld empire when Kick-Ass gets drawn into the fray. But Frank's men play rough, and his son, Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), is about to become Kick-Ass' very first arch nemesis. When Chris assumes the persona of Red Mist, the stage is set for a superhero showdown that could spell the end of Kick-Ass once and for all. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/JQklncyUqbUoaIs0MMJYAFLqiQo=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/37/11173707_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/JQklncyUqbUoaIs0MMJYAFLqiQo=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/37/11173707_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/JQklncyUqbUoaIs0MMJYAFLqiQo=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/37/11173707_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/JQklncyUqbUoaIs0MMJYAFLqiQo=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/37/11173707_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Aaron Taylor-Johnson","id":"326397411","characters":["Dave Lizewski/Kick-Ass"]},{"name":"Nicolas Cage","id":"162653923","characters":["Damon Macready/Big Daddy"]},{"name":"Christopher Mintz-Plasse","id":"770679139","characters":["Chris D'Amico/Red Mist"]},{"name":"Mark Strong (II)","id":"478055173","characters":["Frank D'Amico"]},{"name":"Chloe Grace Moretz","id":"771410621","characters":["Mindy Macready/Hit Girl"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Matthew Vaughn"}],"studio":"Lionsgate","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1250777"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1250777","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1217700-kick_ass/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770786150/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770786150/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770786150/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770786150.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
