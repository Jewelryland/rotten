But the project seems doomed from the start-not least because his predecessor on the project, Lang's long-term aide, died in an unfortunate accident. As The Ghost works, he begins to uncover clues suggesting his predecessor may have stumbled on a dark secret linking Lang to the CIA-and that somehow this information is hidden in the manuscript he left behind. Was Lang in the service of the American intelligence agency while he was prime minister? And, was The Ghost's predecessor murdered because of the appalling truth he uncovered?","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/POvgIslINzNScGG0xWLVv_dQxOU=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/10/95/22/10952222_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/POvgIslINzNScGG0xWLVv_dQxOU=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/10/95/22/10952222_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/POvgIslINzNScGG0xWLVv_dQxOU=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/10/95/22/10952222_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/POvgIslINzNScGG0xWLVv_dQxOU=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/10/95/22/10952222_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Ewan McGregor","id":"162652152","characters":["The Ghost"]},{"name":"Pierce Brosnan","id":"162663451","characters":["Adam Lang"]},{"name":"Kim Cattrall","id":"162655985","characters":["Amelia Bly"]},{"name":"Olivia Williams","id":"162662296","characters":["Ruth Lang"]},{"name":"Eli Wallach","id":"162656435","characters":["Vineyard Old Man"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Roman Polanski"},{"name":"Roman Pola?ski"}],"studio":"Summit Entertainment","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1139328"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1139328","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10012063-ghost_writer/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770810665/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770810665/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770810665/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770810665.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
