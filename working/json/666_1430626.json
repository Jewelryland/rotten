Band of Misfits, Hugh Grant stars in his first animated role as the luxuriantly bearded Pirate Captain - a boundlessly enthusiastic, if somewhat less-than-successful, terror of the High Seas. With a rag-tag crew at his side (Martin Freeman, Brendan Gleeson, Russell Tovey, and Ashley Jensen), and seemingly blind to the impossible odds stacked against him, the Captain has one dream: to beat his bitter rivals Black Bellamy (Jeremy Piven) and Cutlass Liz (Salma Hayek) to the much coveted Pirate Of The Year Award. It's a quest that takes our heroes from the shores of exotic Blood Island to the foggy streets of Victorian London. Along the way they battle a diabolical queen (Imelda Staunton) and team up with a haplessly smitten young scientist (David Tennant), but never lose sight of what a pirate loves best: adventure! -- (C) Sony","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/4uxJTyVBdD-WENNR0GeDrn1AZBg=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/64/11166427_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/4uxJTyVBdD-WENNR0GeDrn1AZBg=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/64/11166427_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/4uxJTyVBdD-WENNR0GeDrn1AZBg=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/64/11166427_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/4uxJTyVBdD-WENNR0GeDrn1AZBg=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/64/11166427_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Hugh Grant","id":"162660188","characters":["The Pirate Captain"]},{"name":"Brendan Gleeson","id":"162652243","characters":["The Pirate with Gout"]},{"name":"Martin Freeman (II)","id":"162652296","characters":["The Pirate with a Scarf"]},{"name":"David Tennant","id":"364606822","characters":["Charles Darwin"]},{"name":"Imelda Staunton","id":"162693364","characters":["Queen Victoria"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Peter Lord"},{"name":"Jeff Newitt"}],"studio":"Sony Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1430626"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1430626","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_pirates_band_of_misfits/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770863878/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770863878/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770863878/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770863878.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
