Every time Milo gets close to resourceful reporter Nicole, she gives him the slip. A high-profile murder has been committed, and Nicole is determined to stay out of jail long enough to crack the case. And she must be getting close, because now someone is trying to take them both out. They may not have been able to make marriage work, but if Milo and Nicole can just stay alive long enough to solve the murder, they might discover they're not such a bad team after all. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/elH6ov5FQ979CQ4n3RZx2Z5ztac=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/98/11169894_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/elH6ov5FQ979CQ4n3RZx2Z5ztac=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/98/11169894_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/elH6ov5FQ979CQ4n3RZx2Z5ztac=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/98/11169894_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/elH6ov5FQ979CQ4n3RZx2Z5ztac=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/98/11169894_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Jennifer Aniston","id":"162655148","characters":["Nicole Hurley"]},{"name":"Gerard Butler","id":"162659102","characters":["Milo Boyd"]},{"name":"Christine Baranski","id":"238474423","characters":["Kitty Hurley"]},{"name":"Giovanni Perez","id":"770921514","characters":["Uncle Sam"]},{"name":"Jason Sudeikis","id":"770702194","characters":["Stewart"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Andy Tennant"}],"studio":"Sony Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1038919"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1038919","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1220551-bounty_hunter/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770856804/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770856804/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770856804/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770856804.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
