Upon arrival, he finds that reports of his brother's death are greatly exaggerated, and he's soon caught up in the dangerous and unpredictable world of drug commerce in the backwaters of the Southwest. In the process, he reconnects with his eccentric mother, meets a wise and educated young woman who has bypassed academia in favor of the gentler rhythms of life, and unwittingly helps his troubled brother settle a score with a pernicious drug lord who uses Tulsa's small Jewish community for cover.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/PAzjlN_SwGEbb2DDhO9l681tiP4=/54x76/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/32/11153204_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/PAzjlN_SwGEbb2DDhO9l681tiP4=/54x76/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/32/11153204_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/PAzjlN_SwGEbb2DDhO9l681tiP4=/54x76/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/32/11153204_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/PAzjlN_SwGEbb2DDhO9l681tiP4=/54x76/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/32/11153204_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Edward Norton","id":"162660884","characters":["Bill Kincaid","Bill Kincaid/Brady Kincaid","Brady Kincaid"]},{"name":"Susan Sarandon","id":"162654579","characters":["Daisy"]},{"name":"Keri Russell","id":"162685092","characters":["Janet"]},{"name":"Richard Dreyfuss","id":"162661009","characters":["Pug Rothbaum"]},{"name":"Josh Pais","id":"364623049","characters":["Ken Feinman"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Tim Blake Nelson"}],"studio":"First Look Studios","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1151359"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1151359","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10010334-leaves_of_grass/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770790557/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770790557/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770790557/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770790557.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
