Like most teenagers, Peter is trying to figure out who he is and how he got to be the person he is today. As Peter discovers a mysterious briefcase that belonged to his father, he begins a quest to understand his parents' disappearance - leading him directly to Oscorp and the lab of Dr. Curt Connors (Ifans), his father's former partner. As Spider-Man is set on a collision course with Connors' alter-ego, The Lizard, Peter will make life-altering choices to use his powers and shape his destiny to become a hero. -- (C) Sony","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/dM6eovEG3C47rNYu0TG7VY1W-lo=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/74/11167406_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/dM6eovEG3C47rNYu0TG7VY1W-lo=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/74/11167406_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/dM6eovEG3C47rNYu0TG7VY1W-lo=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/74/11167406_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/dM6eovEG3C47rNYu0TG7VY1W-lo=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/74/11167406_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Andrew Garfield","id":"770779702","characters":["Spider-Man/Peter Parker"]},{"name":"Emma Stone","id":"770683296","characters":["Gwen Stacy"]},{"name":"Rhys Ifans","id":"162669070","characters":["The Lizard/Dr. Curt Connors"]},{"name":"Denis Leary","id":"162659182","characters":["Captain Stacy"]},{"name":"Martin Sheen","id":"162660009","characters":["Uncle Ben"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Marc Webb"}],"studio":"Sony Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"0948470"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=0948470","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_amazing_spider_man/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770771659/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770771659/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770771659/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770771659.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
