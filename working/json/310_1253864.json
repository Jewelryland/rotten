With the invincible Bow, the king will be able to overthrow the Gods of Olympus and become the undisputed master of his world. With ruthless efficiency, Hyperion and his legions destroy everything in their wake, and it seems nothing will stop the evil king's mission. As village after village is obliterated, a stonemason named Theseus (Henry Cavill) vows to avenge the death of his mother in one of Hyperion's raids. When Theseus meets the Sybelline Oracle, Phaedra (Freida Pinto), her disturbing visions of the young man's future convince her that he is the key to stopping the destruction. With her help, Theseus assembles a small band of followers and embraces his destiny in a final desperate battle for the future of humanity. -- (C) Relativity Media","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/KnI0PLbVHh1MpVPnMztoQUaQJAM=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/89/11158957_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/KnI0PLbVHh1MpVPnMztoQUaQJAM=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/89/11158957_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/KnI0PLbVHh1MpVPnMztoQUaQJAM=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/89/11158957_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/KnI0PLbVHh1MpVPnMztoQUaQJAM=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/89/11158957_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Henry Cavill","id":"341817917","characters":["Theseus"]},{"name":"Mickey Rourke","id":"162652508","characters":["King Hyperion"]},{"name":"Freida Pinto","id":"770799097","characters":["Phaedra"]},{"name":"Stephen Dorff","id":"162666782","characters":["Stavros"]},{"name":"Kellan Lutz","id":"770685152","characters":["Poseidon"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Tarsem Singh"},{"name":"Tarsem Singh Dhandwar"}],"studio":"Relativity Media","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1253864"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1253864","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/immortals_2011/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771030924/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771030924/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771030924/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771030924.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
