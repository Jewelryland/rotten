Greg (Ben Stiller) and Pam (Teri Polo) have been together for ten years, and now they're the proud parents of two adorable twins. But money is tight, and in order to keep his family afloat, devoted nurse Greg takes a second job working for a drug company. But that development doesn't sit well with Jack, whose previous suspicions regarding his hapless son-in-law soon come back in full force after learning of this development. With the twins' birthday fast approaching, the proud parents invite the entire clan over to celebrate in style, including Kevin (Owen Wilson), who still carries a torch for his pretty ex Pam. As the festivities get under way, Greg takes every opportunity available to prove to Jack that he's fully capable of providing for his family. Now Greg has one last chance to prove that he's trustworthy. Should he fail, the circle of trust will be broken for good. Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand, Laura Dern, and Jessica Alba co-star. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/xkcNW1k3_IASvNx4ftAV-D5bL7c=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/12/11171282_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/xkcNW1k3_IASvNx4ftAV-D5bL7c=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/12/11171282_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/xkcNW1k3_IASvNx4ftAV-D5bL7c=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/12/11171282_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/xkcNW1k3_IASvNx4ftAV-D5bL7c=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/12/11171282_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Robert De Niro","id":"162655521","characters":["Jack Byrnes"]},{"name":"Ben Stiller","id":"162659371","characters":["Greg Focker"]},{"name":"Owen Wilson","id":"162652836","characters":["Kevin Rawley"]},{"name":"Blythe Danner","id":"162659375","characters":["Dina Byrnes"]},{"name":"Teri Polo","id":"162659376","characters":["Pam Focker"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Paul Weitz"}],"studio":"Universal Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"0970866"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=0970866","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/little_fockers/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770685374/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770685374/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770685374/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770685374.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
