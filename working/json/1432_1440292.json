Worried that his mom is having an affair with New Age weirdo Graham, Oliver monitors his parents' sex life by charting the dimmer switch in their bedroom. He also forges suggestive love letters from his mom to dad. Meanwhile, Oliver attempts to woo his classmate, Jordana, a self-professed pyromaniac who supervises his journal writing - especially the bits about her. When necessary, she orders him to cross things out. -- (C) Weinstein","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/5XRhYdsHK0bt0KzCtwh5zGlREIs=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/03/11160366_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/5XRhYdsHK0bt0KzCtwh5zGlREIs=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/03/11160366_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/5XRhYdsHK0bt0KzCtwh5zGlREIs=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/03/11160366_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/5XRhYdsHK0bt0KzCtwh5zGlREIs=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/03/11160366_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Craig Roberts","id":"770877503","characters":["Oliver Tate"]},{"name":"Noah Taylor","id":"162708662","characters":["Lloyd Tate"]},{"name":"Sally Hawkins","id":"588111244","characters":["Jill Tate"]},{"name":"Paddy Considine","id":"162652573","characters":["Graham Purvis"]},{"name":"Yasmin Paige","id":"770677265","characters":["Jordana Bevan"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Richard Ayoade"}],"studio":"The Weinstein Company","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1440292"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1440292","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/submarine-2010/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770875099/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770875099/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770875099/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770875099.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
