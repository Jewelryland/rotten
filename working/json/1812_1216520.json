After contemplating suicide, Rebecca finds consolation in the idea of cloning Matt back to life. Although society at large hasn't fully accepted the idea of human cloning, and often ostracizes those who have been cloned, Rebecca decides to forge ahead with her plans to give birth to her lost love - literally. -- (C) Olive","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/rnlzSihiLTSOJSDThwy1bNxuGD8=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/41/11164101_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/rnlzSihiLTSOJSDThwy1bNxuGD8=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/41/11164101_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/rnlzSihiLTSOJSDThwy1bNxuGD8=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/41/11164101_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/rnlzSihiLTSOJSDThwy1bNxuGD8=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/41/11164101_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Eva Green","id":"162652241","characters":["Rebecca"]},{"name":"Matt Smith (XI)","id":"770773984","characters":["Thomas"]},{"name":"Peter Wight","id":"770721995","characters":["Ralph (Thomas' Father)"]},{"name":"Peter Wright","id":"770723108","characters":["Ralph (Thomas' Father)"]},{"name":"Istvan Lenart","id":"770814160","characters":["Henry"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Benedek Fliegauf"},{"name":"Benedek Fliegrauf"}],"studio":"Olive Films","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1216520"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1216520","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/womb/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770810574/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770810574/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770810574/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770810574.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
