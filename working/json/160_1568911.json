When they are forcefully parted, the film follows the extraordinary journey of the horse as he moves through the war, changing and inspiring the lives of all those he meets-British cavalry, German soldiers, and a French farmer and his granddaughter-before the story reaches its emotional climax in the heart of No Man's Land. The First World War is experienced through the journey of this horse-an odyssey of joy and sorrow, passionate friendship and high adventure. --(C) Dreamworks","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/06/11160680_tmb.jpg","profile":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/06/11160680_tmb.jpg","detailed":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/06/11160680_tmb.jpg","original":"http://content6.flixster.com/movie/11/16/06/11160680_tmb.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Peter Mullan","id":"162694437","characters":["Ted Narracott"]},{"name":"Jeremy Irvine","id":"771097762","characters":["Albert Narracott"]},{"name":"Emily Watson","id":"162654016","characters":["Rosie Narracott"]},{"name":"Niels Arestrup","id":"266555632","characters":["Grandfather"]},{"name":"David Thewlis","id":"162656526","characters":["Lyons"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Steven Spielberg"}],"studio":"Walt Disney Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1568911"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1568911","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/war_horse/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771041783/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771041783/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771041783/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771041783.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
