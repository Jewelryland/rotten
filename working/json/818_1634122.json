But when his agency superiors learn of an attempt against the Chinese premier's life, they must hunt down the highly unorthodox agent. Now that the world needs him once again, Johnny English is back in action. With one shot at redemption, he must employ the latest in hi-tech gadgets to unravel a web of conspiracy that runs throughout the KGB, CIA and even MI-7. With mere days until a heads of state conference, one man must use every trick in his playbook to protect us all. For Johnny English, disaster may be an option, but failure never is. -- (C) Offical Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Otr4RP_EyRqzAB1-A63E3qlEgUU=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/37/11163780_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Otr4RP_EyRqzAB1-A63E3qlEgUU=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/37/11163780_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Otr4RP_EyRqzAB1-A63E3qlEgUU=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/37/11163780_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Otr4RP_EyRqzAB1-A63E3qlEgUU=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/37/11163780_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Rowan Atkinson","id":"162669051","characters":["Johnny English"]},{"name":"Gillian Anderson","id":"162661592","characters":["Pamela Thornton/\"Pegasus\""]},{"name":"Dominic West","id":"162662802","characters":["Special Agent Simon Ambrose"]},{"name":"Rosamund Pike","id":"162654705","characters":["Kate Sumner"]},{"name":"Daniel Kaluuya","id":"770911249","characters":["Tucker"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Oliver Parker"}],"studio":"Universal Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1634122"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1634122","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/johnny_english_reborn/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771220874/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771220874/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771220874/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771220874.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
