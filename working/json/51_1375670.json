Over the course of the Fourth of July weekend, the five friends realize that just because they've all grown up and started families doesn't mean that they've lost that old spark. Adulthood is what you make of it, and no one at the lake house is eager to be the grown-up of the gang. Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Kevin James, David Spade, and Rob Schneider star in a film written by Sandler and Fred Wolf, and directed by Dennis Dugan (I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry, You Don't Mess with the Zohan). Maria Bello, Salma Hayek, and Maya Rudolph co-star. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/5pe2PHKA1WjtDO0_3iUxla7xoec=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/98/11169896_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/5pe2PHKA1WjtDO0_3iUxla7xoec=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/98/11169896_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/5pe2PHKA1WjtDO0_3iUxla7xoec=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/98/11169896_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/5pe2PHKA1WjtDO0_3iUxla7xoec=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/98/11169896_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Adam Sandler","id":"162652550","characters":["Lenny Feder"]},{"name":"Kevin James","id":"326298578","characters":["Eric Lamonsoff"]},{"name":"Chris Rock","id":"162652551","characters":["Kurt McKenzie"]},{"name":"David Spade","id":"162656213","characters":["Marcus Higgins"]},{"name":"Rob Schneider","id":"162653162","characters":["Rob Hilliard"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Dennis Dugan"}],"studio":"Sony Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1375670"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1375670","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/grown_ups/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770809280/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770809280/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770809280/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770809280.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
