Despite his success as an author Henry's return home has sparked all of the youthful dreams, desires and particularly disappointments he's never quite gotten over, specifically his unrequited affection for the girl who is now the local pharmacist: the elusive Scarlet Smith (Winona Ryder). Between run-ins with the outcast friends he left behind Big Girl (Sean Astin) and Wino (Josh Holloway), the school principal (Chevy Chase) and a seductive senior, Shasta O'Neil (Hilary Duff) who clearly has the hots for him, Henry is sent spinning through a time warp that incites all the old emotions and challenges of the world he grew up in. -- (C) Initiate Productions","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/FZIFqIfdVrucYWLUnaZYcgQEVmA=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/02/11160219_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/FZIFqIfdVrucYWLUnaZYcgQEVmA=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/02/11160219_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/FZIFqIfdVrucYWLUnaZYcgQEVmA=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/02/11160219_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/FZIFqIfdVrucYWLUnaZYcgQEVmA=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/02/11160219_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Mark Polish","id":"162727792","characters":["Henry McCarthy"]},{"name":"Winona Ryder","id":"162659115","characters":["Scarlet Smith"]},{"name":"Hilary Duff","id":"162652728","characters":["Shasta O'Neil"]},{"name":"Sean Astin","id":"162659177","characters":["Big Girl"]},{"name":"Josh Holloway","id":"558068958","characters":["Wino"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Ted Smith"}],"studio":"Cinedigm Films","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1235807"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1235807","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/stay_cool/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770783621/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770783621/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770783621/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770783621.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
