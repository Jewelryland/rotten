Diagnosed with a rare degenerative condition, Chloe is on a long list to receive a double lung transplant. As her health worsens, Paul becomes desperate to save his young child...so desperate that he'll risk everything to organize an operation. When Paul learns of a Dr. Novarro who performs transplants in Juarez, Mexico, he heads south in a frantic search for the only man who may be able to save Chloe. But after arriving, he realizes Dr. Novarro's medical ring runs deep into a criminal underworld where his patients aren't donors - they're victims. With his career, his family and his life on the line, Paul finds himself at a critical crossroads: expose a massive, illegal harvesting operation and save the lives of hundreds of children, or save the life of his daughter. -- (C) IFC Films","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/OmRBnhL2lf5b031oetsKrx0Va2s=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/36/11153632_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/OmRBnhL2lf5b031oetsKrx0Va2s=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/36/11153632_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/OmRBnhL2lf5b031oetsKrx0Va2s=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/36/11153632_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/OmRBnhL2lf5b031oetsKrx0Va2s=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/36/11153632_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Mia Stallard","id":"771067182","characters":["Chloe"]},{"name":"Dermot Mulroney","id":"162652930","characters":["Paul Stanton"]},{"name":"Diane Kruger","id":"162659094","characters":["Diane Stanton"]},{"name":"Vincent Perez","id":"162671289","characters":["Dr. Martinez"]},{"name":"Sam Shepard","id":"162662816","characters":["James Harrison"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Baltasar Kormakur"}],"studio":"IFC Films","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1196340"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1196340","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/inhale/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771208569/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771208569/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771208569/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771208569.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
