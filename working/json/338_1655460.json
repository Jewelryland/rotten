After George is downsized out of his job, they find themselves with only one option: to move in with George's awful brother in Atlanta. On the way there, George and Linda stumble upon Elysium, an idyllic community populated by colorful characters who embrace a different way of looking at things. Money? It can't buy happiness. Careers? Who needs them? Clothes? Only if you want them. Is Elysium the fresh start George and Linda need? Or will the change of perspective cause more problems than it solves? -- (C) Universal","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/MarK-Rx3rrUd1EoDjqb5tkKQK0A=/51x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/38/11163800_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/MarK-Rx3rrUd1EoDjqb5tkKQK0A=/51x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/38/11163800_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/MarK-Rx3rrUd1EoDjqb5tkKQK0A=/51x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/38/11163800_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/MarK-Rx3rrUd1EoDjqb5tkKQK0A=/51x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/38/11163800_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Paul Rudd","id":"162653309","characters":["George"]},{"name":"Jennifer Aniston","id":"162655148","characters":["Linda"]},{"name":"Justin Theroux","id":"162653585","characters":["Seth"]},{"name":"Alan Alda","id":"162660526","characters":["Carvin"]},{"name":"Malin Akerman","id":"512896981","characters":["Eva"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"David Wain"}],"studio":"Universal Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1655460"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1655460","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wanderlust_2011/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771211555/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771211555/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771211555/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771211555.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
