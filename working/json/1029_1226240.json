As they are about to play their 25th anniversary concert, quite possibly their last, only their intimate bond and the power of music can preserve their legacy. Inspired by and structured around Beethoven's Opus 131 String Quartet in C-sharp minor, A LATE QUARTET pays homage to chamber music and the cultural world of New York.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/u6R2M6Ij8e9Vs7QzjvBDjwnD04w=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/71/11167105_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/u6R2M6Ij8e9Vs7QzjvBDjwnD04w=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/71/11167105_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/u6R2M6Ij8e9Vs7QzjvBDjwnD04w=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/71/11167105_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/u6R2M6Ij8e9Vs7QzjvBDjwnD04w=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/71/11167105_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Philip Seymour Hoffman","id":"162654287","characters":["Robert Gelbart (Violin)"]},{"name":"Catherine Keener","id":"162652281","characters":["Juliette Gelbart (Viola)"]},{"name":"Christopher Walken","id":"162652837","characters":["Peter Mitchell (Cello)"]},{"name":"Mark Ivanir","id":"770680308","characters":["Daniel Lerner (Violin)"]},{"name":"Imogen Poots","id":"770678493","characters":["Alexandra Gelbart (Violin)"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Yaron Zilberman"}],"studio":"Entertainment One","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1226240"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1226240","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_late_quartet/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771314091/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771314091/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771314091/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771314091.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
