At first enslaved by the diminutive and industrious Liliputians, and later declared their hero, Gulliver comes to learn that it's how big you are on the inside that counts.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/w_mcet24rL-LPhUeqq9DzeDo8Vo=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/13/27/11132705_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/w_mcet24rL-LPhUeqq9DzeDo8Vo=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/13/27/11132705_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/w_mcet24rL-LPhUeqq9DzeDo8Vo=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/13/27/11132705_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/w_mcet24rL-LPhUeqq9DzeDo8Vo=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/13/27/11132705_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Jack Black","id":"162662218","characters":["Lemuel Gulliver"]},{"name":"Jason Segel","id":"770670222","characters":["Horatio"]},{"name":"Emily Blunt","id":"162685827","characters":["Princess Mary"]},{"name":"Amanda Peet","id":"162652454","characters":["Darcy Silverman"]},{"name":"Billy Connolly","id":"162662548","characters":["King Theodore"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Rob Letterman"}],"studio":"20th Century Fox","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1320261"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1320261","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gullivers-travels-2010/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770808129/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770808129/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770808129/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770808129.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
