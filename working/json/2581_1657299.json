However, dilapidated buildings and greedy islanders are the least of the problems that the wedding party and their Hollywood entourage have to deal with, as Marco (Federico Castelluccio) the ingenious paparazzo tracks them down in his mission to photograph the celebrity wedding of the year. Steve and his assistant Emma (Sally Phillips) must find a decoy bride and think that local girl Katie (Kelly MacDonald) will be an ideal replacement. But when Katie meets James, sparks fly, dresses get ruined and love gets complicated. -- (C) IFC","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/u5Ddpx8inxVYGqsr9f5i3NSFsNY=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/36/11163604_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/u5Ddpx8inxVYGqsr9f5i3NSFsNY=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/36/11163604_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/u5Ddpx8inxVYGqsr9f5i3NSFsNY=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/36/11163604_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/u5Ddpx8inxVYGqsr9f5i3NSFsNY=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/36/11163604_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Maureen Beattie","id":"571652095"},{"name":"Samuel Roukin","id":"770792773"},{"name":"Hamish Clark","id":"770787323"},{"name":"Vivienne Harvey","id":"770782312"},{"name":"Patrick Regis","id":"341816837"}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Sheree Folkson"}],"studio":"IFC Films","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1657299"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1657299","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_decoy_bride/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771255568/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771255568/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771255568/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771255568.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
