Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Seth Rogen star as best friends whose lives are changed by a cancer diagnosis in this new comedy directed by Jonathan Levine from a script by Will Reiser. 50/50 is the story of a guy's transformative and, yes, sometimes funny journey to health - drawing its emotional core from Will Reiser's own experience with cancer and reminding us that friendship and love, no matter what bizarre turns they take, are the greatest healers. -- (C) Summit Entertainment","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/M_m69S91SVHg4L35_1gRZEYuu9c=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/36/11173698_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/M_m69S91SVHg4L35_1gRZEYuu9c=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/36/11173698_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/M_m69S91SVHg4L35_1gRZEYuu9c=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/36/11173698_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/M_m69S91SVHg4L35_1gRZEYuu9c=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/36/11173698_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt","id":"162666960","characters":["Adam"]},{"name":"Seth Rogen","id":"162653310","characters":["Kyle"]},{"name":"Anna Kendrick","id":"528367112","characters":["Katherine"]},{"name":"Bryce Dallas Howard","id":"162660901","characters":["Rachael"]},{"name":"Anjelica Huston","id":"162660306","characters":["Diane"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Jonathan Levine"}],"studio":"Summit Entertainment","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1306980"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1306980","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/5050_2011/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771234468/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771234468/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771234468/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771234468.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
