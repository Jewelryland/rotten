{"id":771267283,"title":"Sleepwalk With Me","year":2012,"genres":["Drama","Comedy"],"mpaa_rating":"PG-13","runtime":90,"critics_consensus":"","release_dates":{"theater":"2012-08-24","dvd":"2012-12-18"},"ratings":{"critics_rating":"Certified Fresh","critics_score":84,"audience_rating":"Upright","audience_score":70},"synopsis":"\"I'm going to tell you a story, and it's true....I always have to tell people that.\" So asserts comedian-turned-playwright-turned-filmmaker Mike Birbiglia directly to the viewer at the outset of his autobiographically inspired, fictional feature debut. Birbiglia wears his incisive wit on his sleeve while portraying a cinematic surrogate. We are thrust into the tale of a burgeoning stand-up comedian struggling with the stress of a stalled career, a stale relationship threatening to race out of his control, and the wild spurts of severe sleepwalking he is desperate to ignore. Based on the successful one-man show, Sleepwalk With Me engages in the kind of passionate and personal storytelling that transfigures intimate anguish into comic art. -- (C) IFC","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/r3EGxAkFDTUctGynN2266-WlAl8=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/58/11165803_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/r3EGxAkFDTUctGynN2266-WlAl8=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/58/11165803_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/r3EGxAkFDTUctGynN2266-WlAl8=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/58/11165803_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/r3EGxAkFDTUctGynN2266-WlAl8=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/58/11165803_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Mike Birbiglia","id":"770762134","characters":["Matt Pandamiglio"]},{"name":"Lauren Ambrose","id":"364612974","characters":["Abby"]},{"name":"James Rebhorn","id":"534309564","characters":["Frank Pandamiglio"]},{"name":"Carol Kane","id":"162652477","characters":["Linda Pandamiglio"]},{"name":"Cristin Milioti","id":"770852343","characters":["Janet"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Mike Birbiglia"},{"name":"Seth Barrish"}],"studio":"IFC Films","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"2077851"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=2077851","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sleepwalk_with_me_2012/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771267283/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771267283/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771267283/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771267283.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
