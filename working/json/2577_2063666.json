Demoralized and uncertain of her future, Amy begins an affair with a 19-year-old actor (Christopher Abbott) that jumpstarts her passion for life and helps her discover an independence and sense of purpose that she has missed for years. Coupling Danner's subtle, moving performance as a frustrated empty nester with Lynskey's endearing and nuanced depiction of both the comic and tragic coming together at a crossroads, Hello I Must Be Going is a modern, unconventional love story infused with sex, humor, and emotional honesty - everything Amy will need to get on in life. -- (C) Oscilloscope","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/iwTi4sFm8s0EMnFjgkcSPC1ywHI=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/58/11165808_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/iwTi4sFm8s0EMnFjgkcSPC1ywHI=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/58/11165808_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/iwTi4sFm8s0EMnFjgkcSPC1ywHI=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/58/11165808_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/iwTi4sFm8s0EMnFjgkcSPC1ywHI=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/58/11165808_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Melanie Lynskey","id":"208150762","characters":["Amy"]},{"name":"Blythe Danner","id":"162659375","characters":["Ruth"]},{"name":"Christopher Abbott","id":"771075120","characters":["Jeremy"]},{"name":"John Rubinstein","id":"770689041","characters":["Stan"]},{"name":"Julie White","id":"770699518","characters":["Gwen"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Todd Louiso"}],"studio":"Oscilloscope Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"2063666"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=2063666","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hello_i_must_be_going_2012/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771266700/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771266700/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771266700/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771266700.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
