Beth (Kristen Bell) is at a point in her life where love seems like a luxury she just can't afford. Years of waiting for that perfect romance has made Beth bitter, and one day, while vacationing in Rome, she cynically plucks a handful of coins from a local fountain of love. Almost immediately thereafter, Beth finds herself fending off the advances of a diminutive sausage magnate (Danny DeVito), a lanky street magician (Jon Heder), a doting painter (Will Arnett), and a narcissistic male model (Dax Shepard). Meanwhile, a smitten reporter (Josh Duhamel) does his best to convince Beth that true love isn't just a topic of fairy tales and romance novels.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/RSAlq2aFbxYNZVssrzCg5E1535A=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/12/18/11121863_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/RSAlq2aFbxYNZVssrzCg5E1535A=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/12/18/11121863_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/RSAlq2aFbxYNZVssrzCg5E1535A=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/12/18/11121863_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/RSAlq2aFbxYNZVssrzCg5E1535A=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/12/18/11121863_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Kristen Bell","id":"326395677","characters":["Beth"]},{"name":"Josh Duhamel","id":"162669304","characters":["Nick"]},{"name":"Anjelica Huston","id":"162660306","characters":["Celeste"]},{"name":"Danny DeVito","id":"162664270","characters":["Al"]},{"name":"Will Arnett","id":"335717464","characters":["Antonio"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Mark Steven Johnson"}],"studio":"Walt Disney Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1185416"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1185416","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/when_in_rome/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770801761/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770801761/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770801761/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770801761.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
