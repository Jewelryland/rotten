Beau Bridges plays an avuncular federal marshal, a good ol' boy, who turns out to be one of the operation's masterminds while Matt O'Leary is equally repellent as the boss's wildly erratic, drug-addled right-hand man. But it's Chung who breathes life into a story that could have been reduced to violent, even pornographic sensationalism, if not told so compassionately from the victim's point of view. Human trafficking is a $32 billion-a-year business, perpetrated throughout the world. EDEN gives a thoughtful, albeit mind-boggling perspective on how these crimes are sometimes committed in America within plain sight.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/C6-_ZZN6ZmImeXo-JvERlJbUZYE=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/95/11169598_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/C6-_ZZN6ZmImeXo-JvERlJbUZYE=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/95/11169598_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/C6-_ZZN6ZmImeXo-JvERlJbUZYE=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/95/11169598_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/C6-_ZZN6ZmImeXo-JvERlJbUZYE=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/95/11169598_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Jamie Chung","id":"770694653","characters":["Eden"]},{"name":"Matt O'Leary","id":"351524952","characters":["Vaughan"]},{"name":"Beau Bridges","id":"162664689","characters":["Bob Gault"]},{"name":"Jeanine Monterozza","id":"771225332","characters":["Priscilla"]},{"name":"Scott Mechlowicz","id":"162690724","characters":["Jesse"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Megan Griffiths"},{"name":"Mia Hansen-Love"}],"studio":"Phase 4 Films","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1734433"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1734433","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/eden_2012/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771271074/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771271074/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771271074/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771271074.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
