But as they settle into their new life, they discover their perfect home was the murder scene of a mother and her children. And the entire city believes it was at the hands of the husband who survived. When Will investigates the tragedy, his only lead comes from Ann Paterson (Naomi Watts), a neighbor who was close to the family that died. As Will and Ann piece together the disturbing puzzle, they discover that the story of the last man to leave Will's dream house will be just as horrifying to the one who came next. -- (C) Universal Pictures","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/ncmKkXI6KS9u5-XLkrGig42XUWg=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/36/11163637_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/ncmKkXI6KS9u5-XLkrGig42XUWg=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/36/11163637_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/ncmKkXI6KS9u5-XLkrGig42XUWg=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/36/11163637_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/ncmKkXI6KS9u5-XLkrGig42XUWg=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/36/11163637_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Daniel Craig","id":"162687443","characters":["Will Atenton"]},{"name":"Rachel Weisz","id":"162653682","characters":["Libby Atenton"]},{"name":"Naomi Watts","id":"162654749","characters":["Ann Paterson"]},{"name":"Elias Koteas","id":"162654218","characters":["Boyce"]},{"name":"Marton Csokas","id":"162653240","characters":["Jack Patterson"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Jim Sheridan"}],"studio":"Universal Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1462041"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1462041","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dream_house_2011/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771204354/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771204354/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771204354/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771204354.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
