Ren MacCormack (Kenny Wormald) is transplanted from Boston to the small southern town of Bomont where he experiences a heavy dose of culture shock. A few years prior, the community was rocked by a tragic accident that killed five teenagers after a night out and Bomont's local councilmen and the beloved Reverend Shaw Moore (Dennis Quaid) responded by implementing ordinances that prohibit loud music and dancing. Not one to bow to the status quo, Ren challenges the ban, revitalizing the town and falling in love with the minister's troubled daughter Ariel (Julianne Hough) in the process. -- (C) Paramount","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/89/11168941_tmb.jpg","profile":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/89/11168941_tmb.jpg","detailed":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/89/11168941_tmb.jpg","original":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/89/11168941_tmb.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Julianne Hough","id":"770848071","characters":["Ariel Moore"]},{"name":"Kenny Wormald","id":"770820104","characters":["Ren MacComack"]},{"name":"Dennis Quaid","id":"162655527","characters":["Reverend Moore"]},{"name":"Andie MacDowell","id":"162663519","characters":["Vi Moore"]},{"name":"Miles Teller","id":"771077409","characters":["Willard"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Craig Brewer"}],"studio":"Paramount Studios","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1068242"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1068242","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/footloose-2010/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770679603/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770679603/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770679603/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770679603.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
