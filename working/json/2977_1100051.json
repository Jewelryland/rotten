Graham Sutter, a psychotic recluse, kept Martin imprisoned on his derelict pig farm, forcing him to witness and participate in unspeakable horrors. Chosen at random, his victim's screams were drowned out by the rural countryside. For five years, Martin's whereabouts have remained a mystery, until 17 year old Allison Miller (Alexandra Daddario) comes to live with her Uncle, Jonathan (Michael Biehn). While exploring her new surroundings, Allison discovers things aren't quite right at the farmhouse down the road. Her curiosity disturbs a hornet's nest of evil and despair that once torn open, can never be closed. -- (C) Official Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/xzjJvWcqwGl80UbbM0qkjcreutk=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/44/11154429_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/xzjJvWcqwGl80UbbM0qkjcreutk=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/44/11154429_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/xzjJvWcqwGl80UbbM0qkjcreutk=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/44/11154429_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/xzjJvWcqwGl80UbbM0qkjcreutk=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/44/11154429_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Michael Biehn","id":"162681092","characters":["Jonathan Miller"]},{"name":"Alexandra Daddario","id":"770777867","characters":["Allison Miller"]},{"name":"Kathryn Meisle","id":"364620703","characters":["Karen Miller"]},{"name":"Nolan Gerard Funk","id":"770815614","characters":["William"]},{"name":"Brett Rickaby","id":"770988888","characters":["Graham Sutter"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Stevan Mena"}],"studio":"Crimson Films","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1100051"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1100051","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bereavement/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771221366/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771221366/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771221366/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771221366.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
