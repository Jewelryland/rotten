Now married with a new family, Vince takes his long-lost son, Tony Nardella, home with him -- not telling his family who Tony really is. This isn't that unusual, as the Rizzo family is filled with secrets from each other. By bringing his long-lost son into the family, and by exploring a platonic extra-marital affair with a fellow acting student, Vince comes to realize that the only way to grow and truly understand love and intimacy is to face the lies he's told about his past and bring his family and loved ones into his future.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/70yiU1Vp5uO_1hQpAq9ZCcmQrWg=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/13/51/11135132_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/70yiU1Vp5uO_1hQpAq9ZCcmQrWg=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/13/51/11135132_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/70yiU1Vp5uO_1hQpAq9ZCcmQrWg=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/13/51/11135132_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/70yiU1Vp5uO_1hQpAq9ZCcmQrWg=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/13/51/11135132_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Andy Garcia","id":"162672896","characters":["Vince Rizzo"]},{"name":"Julianna Margulies","id":"162663347","characters":["Joyce Rizzo"]},{"name":"Steven Strait","id":"162653560","characters":["Tony Nardella"]},{"name":"Ezra Miller","id":"770824298","characters":["Vinnie Rizzo"]},{"name":"Dominik Garcia-Lorido","id":"770684530","characters":["Vivian Rizzo"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Raymond De Felitta"}],"studio":"Anchor Bay Entertainment","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1174730"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1174730","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/city_island/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770806313/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770806313/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770806313/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770806313.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
