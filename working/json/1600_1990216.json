Instead, he gets stuck waiting for a bus in El Fronteras, a sleepy desert town that's so uninviting that - forget about the ocean - he can hardly find a glass of water. Then, word of his money spreads to the El Fronteras underworld. Under sudden attack from corrupt cops, gangsters, and desperados, the Man must push back his retirement plans, lock and load, and save sleepy El Fronteras through a dizzying display of spectacular gunfights. -- (C) After Dark Films","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/FUi3Yf1QwqOZu6Oo2AL4kM2bqvk=/52x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/45/11164591_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/FUi3Yf1QwqOZu6Oo2AL4kM2bqvk=/52x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/45/11164591_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/FUi3Yf1QwqOZu6Oo2AL4kM2bqvk=/52x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/45/11164591_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/FUi3Yf1QwqOZu6Oo2AL4kM2bqvk=/52x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/45/11164591_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Scott Adkins","id":"770704326","characters":["The Man"]},{"name":"Yvette Yates","id":"771067021","characters":["Anna"]},{"name":"Christian Slater","id":"162652316","characters":["Lieutenant West"]},{"name":"Israel Islas","id":"771405006","characters":["Culebra"]},{"name":"Erando Gonzalez","id":"770781066","characters":["Chief Espinoza"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Eduardo Rodriguez"},{"name":"Moshe Diamont"}],"studio":"After Dark Films","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1990216"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1990216","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/el_gringo/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771304891/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771304891/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771304891/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771304891.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
