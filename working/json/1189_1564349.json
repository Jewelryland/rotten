Swimming free, a young dolphin is caught in a crab trap, severely damaging her tail. She is rescued and transported to the Clearwater Marine Hospital, where she is named Winter. But her fight for survival has just begun. Without a tail, Winter's prognosis is dire. It will take the expertise of a dedicated marine biologist, the ingenuity of a brilliant prosthetics doctor, and the unwavering devotion of a young boy to bring about a groundbreaking miracle-a miracle that might not only save Winter but could also help scores of people around the world. -- (C) Warner Bros","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/U24rXCFvVl7yI8lS4dbKWHTkC30=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/36/11163667_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/U24rXCFvVl7yI8lS4dbKWHTkC30=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/36/11163667_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/U24rXCFvVl7yI8lS4dbKWHTkC30=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/36/11163667_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/U24rXCFvVl7yI8lS4dbKWHTkC30=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/36/11163667_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Ashley Judd","id":"162662542","characters":["Lorraine Nelson"]},{"name":"Nathan Gamble","id":"770682696","characters":["Sawyer Nelson"]},{"name":"Kris Kristofferson","id":"162654718","characters":["Reed Haskett"]},{"name":"Cozi Zuehlsdorff","id":"771104989","characters":["Hazel Haskett"]},{"name":"Morgan Freeman","id":"162652224","characters":["Dr. Cameron McCarthy"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Charles Martin Smith"}],"studio":"Warner Bros.
