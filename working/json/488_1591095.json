As devoted parents Josh (Patrick Wilson) and Renai (Rose Byrne) struggle in vain to uncover the root cause of their son's condition, the stress of the situation gradually begins to take its toll on their once-strong relationship. Later, when darkness falls and specters appear to reach out for them from the shadows, the frightened parents realize they're dealing with powers beyond human comprehension. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/ohGE20xWIELiN4zhBjZEecDgJp0=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/94/11169443_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/ohGE20xWIELiN4zhBjZEecDgJp0=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/94/11169443_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/ohGE20xWIELiN4zhBjZEecDgJp0=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/94/11169443_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/ohGE20xWIELiN4zhBjZEecDgJp0=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/94/11169443_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Patrick Wilson","id":"162659104","characters":["Josh Lambert"]},{"name":"Rose Byrne","id":"162699968","characters":["Renai Lambert"]},{"name":"Ty Simpkins","id":"770825948","characters":["Dalton Lambert"]},{"name":"Lin Shaye","id":"364609819","characters":["Elise Rainier"]},{"name":"Leigh Whannell","id":"364604347","characters":["Specs"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"James Wan"}],"studio":"FilmDistrict","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1591095"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1591095","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/insidious/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771205539/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771205539/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771205539/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771205539.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
