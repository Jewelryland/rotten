They struggle numbly through the funeral, the media onslaught, and the awkward pity from relatives and friends. Their already strained marriage is tested as they realize all they have left with each other is their shared grief and confusion-and the unfortunate legacy of their son. This life-altering event forces Bill and Kate to face their feelings of guilt, rage, blame, self-discovery -and ultimately hope- so that they can finally see each other and their chance for happiness again with clear eyes. -- (c) Anchor Bay","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/sH4wL-hSicWYynA_XZO5hGkBaBI=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/70/11157069_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/sH4wL-hSicWYynA_XZO5hGkBaBI=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/70/11157069_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/sH4wL-hSicWYynA_XZO5hGkBaBI=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/70/11157069_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/sH4wL-hSicWYynA_XZO5hGkBaBI=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/70/11157069_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Maria Bello","id":"162654542","characters":["Kate"]},{"name":"Michael Sheen","id":"326395770","characters":["Bill"]},{"name":"Alan Tudyk","id":"162654268","characters":["Eric"]},{"name":"Moon Bloodgood","id":"162652457","characters":["Trish"]},{"name":"Austin Nichols","id":"364627385","characters":["Cooper"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Shawn Ku"}],"studio":"Anchor Bay Films","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1533013"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1533013","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/beautiful_boy/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771208626/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771208626/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771208626/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771208626.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
