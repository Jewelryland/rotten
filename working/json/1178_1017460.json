Now they want to use human DNA in a hybrid that could revolutionize science and medicine. But, when the company that funds their research forbids it, Clive and Elsa secretly take their boldest experimentation underground -- risking their careers by pushing the boundaries of science to serve their own curiosity and ambition. The result is Dren, an amazing, strangely beautiful creature of uncommon intelligence and an array of unexpected physical developments. At first, Dren exceeds their wildest dreams. But as she grows and learns at an accelerated rate, her existence threatens to become their worst nightmare.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Die6R53G9QlsZ7SiekZFGmjCHUk=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/12/44/11124443_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Die6R53G9QlsZ7SiekZFGmjCHUk=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/12/44/11124443_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Die6R53G9QlsZ7SiekZFGmjCHUk=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/12/44/11124443_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Die6R53G9QlsZ7SiekZFGmjCHUk=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/12/44/11124443_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Adrien Brody","id":"162660902","characters":["Clive Nicoli"]},{"name":"Sarah Polley","id":"162692474","characters":["Elsa Kast"]},{"name":"David Hewlett","id":"162688817","characters":["William Barlow"]},{"name":"Brandon McGibbon","id":"770800718","characters":["Gavin Nicoli"]},{"name":"Simona Maicanescu","id":"770818776","characters":["Joan Chorot"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Vincenzo Natali"}],"studio":"Warner Brothers","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1017460"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1017460","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1208173-splice/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770682093/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770682093/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770682093/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770682093.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
