Joanna (Academy Award(R) nominee Keira Knightley) and Michael Reed (Sam Worthington) are 7 years into a successful and happy relationship. They are moving along in their lives together until Joanna meets Laura (Eva Mendes), the stunningly beautiful work colleague whom Michael never mentioned. While Michael is away with Laura on a business trip, Joanna runs into an old but never quite forgotten love, Alex (Guillaume Canet) and agrees to have drinks with him. As the night progresses and temptation increases for the couple, each must confront who they are inside and outside of their relationship. Last Night is ultimately a film about choices - the choice you make to be with someone, to give yourself physically and emotionally, and how to survive all three. --(c) Tribeca","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/-VQRevWHrlRp6XQdsf1MaFUuUr8=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/65/11156500_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/-VQRevWHrlRp6XQdsf1MaFUuUr8=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/65/11156500_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/-VQRevWHrlRp6XQdsf1MaFUuUr8=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/65/11156500_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/-VQRevWHrlRp6XQdsf1MaFUuUr8=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/65/11156500_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Keira Knightley","id":"162654560","characters":["Joanna Reed"]},{"name":"Sam Worthington","id":"326396777","characters":["Michael"]},{"name":"Eva Mendes","id":"162666504"},{"name":"Guillaume Canet","id":"162688284"},{"name":"Daniel Eric Gold","id":"770848945"}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Massy Tadjedin"}],"studio":"Independent Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1294688"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1294688","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1211199-last_night/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770813313/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770813313/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770813313/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770813313.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
