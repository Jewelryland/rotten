Feeling disconnected from his grieving mother (Sandra Bullock) and driven by a relentlessly active mind that refuses to believe in things that can't be observed, Oskar begins searching New York City for the lock that fits a mysterious key he found in his father's closet. His journey through the five boroughs takes him beyond his own loss to a greater understanding of the observable world around him. -- (C) Warner Bros","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/mtQov1d6FRQETDVsSXET49McjM8=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/41/11164141_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/mtQov1d6FRQETDVsSXET49McjM8=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/41/11164141_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/mtQov1d6FRQETDVsSXET49McjM8=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/41/11164141_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/mtQov1d6FRQETDVsSXET49McjM8=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/41/11164141_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Tom Hanks","id":"162655641","characters":["Thomas Schell"]},{"name":"Thomas Horn","id":"771381189","characters":["Oskar Schell"]},{"name":"Sandra Bullock","id":"162652205","characters":["Linda Schell"]},{"name":"Zoe Caldwell","id":"770685976","characters":["Oskar's Grandmother"]},{"name":"Dennis Hearn","id":"771392375","characters":["Minister"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Stephen Daldry"}],"studio":"Warner Bros.
