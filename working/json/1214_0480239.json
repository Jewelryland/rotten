She is drawn to industrialist Henry Rearden (Grant Bowler), one of the few men whose genius and commitment to his own ideas match her own. Rearden's super-strength metal alloy, Rearden Metal, holds the promise that innovation can overcome the slide into anarchy. Using the untested Rearden Metal, they rebuild the critical Taggart rail line in Colorado and pave the way for oil titan Ellis Wyatt (Graham Beckel) to feed the flame of a new American Renaissance. Hope rises again, when Dagny and Rearden discover the design of a revolutionary motor based on static electricity - in an abandoned engine factory - more proof to the sinister theory that the \"men of the mind\" (thinkers, industrialists, scientists, artists, and other innovators) are \"on strike\" and vanishing from society. -- (C) Official Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/wx5GRvc4iYzIchiPEbiy7GuoHTk=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/57/11155716_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/wx5GRvc4iYzIchiPEbiy7GuoHTk=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/57/11155716_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/wx5GRvc4iYzIchiPEbiy7GuoHTk=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/57/11155716_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/wx5GRvc4iYzIchiPEbiy7GuoHTk=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/57/11155716_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Taylor Schilling","id":"771036916","characters":["Dagny Taggart"]},{"name":"Grant  Bowler","id":"364630562","characters":["Henry Rearden"]},{"name":"Matthew Marsden","id":"326299985","characters":["James Taggart"]},{"name":"Edi Gathegi","id":"770810067","characters":["Eddie Willers"]},{"name":"Paul Johansson","id":"376883180","characters":["John Galt"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Paul Johansson"}],"studio":"Rocky Mountain Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"0480239"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=0480239","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/atlas_shrugged_part_i/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771033843/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771033843/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771033843/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771033843.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
