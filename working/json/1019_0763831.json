He has set his sights on New Age guru Dr. Sinja (Cliff Curtis) for his own selfish purposes. But Dr. Sinja is on to him, and Jack's life comes unglued after a magical Bodhi tree mysteriously appears in his backyard. With every word Jack speaks, a leaf falls from the tree and he realizes that when the last leaf falls, both he and the tree are toast. Words have never failed Jack McCall, but now he's got to stop talking and conjure up some outrageous ways to communicate or he's a goner. -- (C) Paramount","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3UWW2AN3CReqiJ1Hq5Sn4AVJCxo=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/91/11169151_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3UWW2AN3CReqiJ1Hq5Sn4AVJCxo=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/91/11169151_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3UWW2AN3CReqiJ1Hq5Sn4AVJCxo=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/91/11169151_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/3UWW2AN3CReqiJ1Hq5Sn4AVJCxo=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/91/11169151_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Eddie Murphy","id":"162657430","characters":["Jack McCall"]},{"name":"Kerry Washington","id":"162682773","characters":["Caroline McCall"]},{"name":"Cliff Curtis","id":"162660161","characters":["Dr. Sinja"]},{"name":"Clark Duke","id":"770790109","characters":["Aaron Wiseberger"]},{"name":"Allison Janney","id":"434230452","characters":["Samantha Davis"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Brian Robbins"}],"studio":"Paramount Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"0763831"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=0763831","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a-thousand-words/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770810465/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770810465/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770810465/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770810465.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
