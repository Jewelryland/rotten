Nevertheless, Gus-who can tell a pitch just by the crack of the bat-refuses to be benched for what may be the final innings of his career. He may not have a choice. The front office of the Atlanta Braves is starting to question his judgment, especially with the country's hottest batting phenom on deck for the draft. The one person who might be able to help is also the one person Gus would never ask: his daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams), an associate at a high-powered Atlanta law firm whose drive and ambition has put her on the fast track to becoming partner. Against her better judgment, and over Gus's objections, Mickey joins him on his latest scouting trip to North Carolina, jeopardizing her own career to save his. -- (C) Warner Bros.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/x5wfZFFNe4fwlJXspWqKyNa2Ih8=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/74/11167431_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/x5wfZFFNe4fwlJXspWqKyNa2Ih8=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/74/11167431_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/x5wfZFFNe4fwlJXspWqKyNa2Ih8=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/74/11167431_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/x5wfZFFNe4fwlJXspWqKyNa2Ih8=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/74/11167431_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Amy Adams","id":"162653029","characters":["Mickey"]},{"name":"Clint Eastwood","id":"162659169","characters":["Gus"]},{"name":"Justin Timberlake","id":"246212645","characters":["Johnny"]},{"name":"John Goodman","id":"162655706","characters":["Pete Klein"]},{"name":"Scott Eastwood","id":"770839379","characters":["Billy Clark"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Robert Lorenz"}],"studio":"Warner Bros.
