Desperate, he goes to the trailer-park to see his father, Ansel (Hayden Church), and he lays out the plan. Chris's mother, who everyone hates, has a life insurance policy that would clear up his debt and make them all rich. The problem is that Chris' mother is very much alive. Enter Detective \"Killer\" Joe Cooper, a hired hit man with the manners of a Southern gentleman, who will do the job - for an upfront fee, that Chris and Ansel can't pay. Just as Joe is about to leave, he spots Dottie (Temple), Chris' innocent younger sister. Joe makes Chris an offer, he'll keep Dottie as sexual collateral until the money is collected and his fee can be paid. -- (C) Voltage Pictures","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/M4c8A3BMdCDxJsh-2hRVJTKrcEo=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/59/11165993_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/M4c8A3BMdCDxJsh-2hRVJTKrcEo=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/59/11165993_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/M4c8A3BMdCDxJsh-2hRVJTKrcEo=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/59/11165993_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/M4c8A3BMdCDxJsh-2hRVJTKrcEo=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/59/11165993_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Matthew McConaughey","id":"162652350","characters":["\"Killer\" Joe Cooper"]},{"name":"Emile Hirsch","id":"162652589","characters":["Chris Smith"]},{"name":"Juno Temple","id":"770696465","characters":["Dottie Smith"]},{"name":"Thomas Haden Church","id":"162683650","characters":["Ansel Smith"]},{"name":"Gina Gershon","id":"162687242","characters":["Sharla Smith"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"William Friedkin"}],"studio":"Independent Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1726669"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1726669","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/killer_joe/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771210952/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771210952/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771210952/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771210952.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
