A shoot-out erupts, and Tripp tackles the smart, pretty teller, Kaitlin (Ashley Judd), to protect her. The gangs--one clearly made up of pros and the other a couple of buffoons--have deadlocked themselves in a Mexican standoff. The bank's security system starts the end-of-day lockdown and seals everyone into the building. As the night evolves, a hilarious game of cat and mouse ensues as Tripp and Kaitlin try to save the day, escape being killed, and avoid falling in love...almost. -- (C) IFC Films","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/-h1tsWypojLYK5EAUIzpaenV810=/53x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/86/11158607_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/-h1tsWypojLYK5EAUIzpaenV810=/53x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/86/11158607_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/-h1tsWypojLYK5EAUIzpaenV810=/53x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/86/11158607_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/-h1tsWypojLYK5EAUIzpaenV810=/53x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/86/11158607_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Patrick Dempsey","id":"162661003","characters":["Tripp"]},{"name":"Ashley Judd","id":"162662542","characters":["Kaitlin"]},{"name":"Tim Blake Nelson","id":"162655595","characters":["Peanut Butter"]},{"name":"Mekhi Phifer","id":"162667293","characters":["Darrien"]},{"name":"Pruitt Taylor Vince","id":"404443001","characters":["Jelly"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Rob Minkoff"}],"studio":"IFC Films","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1541160"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1541160","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/flypaper_2011/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771225870/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771225870/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771225870/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771225870.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
