His deep nostalgia for his own alma mater in Ohio - the dining halls and dorm rooms, the parties and poetry seminars - makes him wonder if his best days are behind him. So when his favorite professor (Richard Jenkins) invites him back to campus to speak at his retirement dinner, Jesse jumps at the chance. Meeting Zibby (Elizabeth Olsen) - a precocious classical music-loving sophomore - awakens in Jesse long-dormant feelings of possibility and connection. -- (C) Official Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/wnlzzSTkj91CIFzA7fY0QGWg3Bw=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/65/11166574_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/wnlzzSTkj91CIFzA7fY0QGWg3Bw=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/65/11166574_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/wnlzzSTkj91CIFzA7fY0QGWg3Bw=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/65/11166574_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/wnlzzSTkj91CIFzA7fY0QGWg3Bw=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/65/11166574_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Josh Radnor","id":"770781183","characters":["Jesse Fisher"]},{"name":"Elizabeth Olsen","id":"770827678","characters":["Zibby"]},{"name":"Richard Jenkins","id":"317606141","characters":["Professor Peter Hoberg"]},{"name":"Allison Janney","id":"434230452","characters":["Professor Judith Fairfield"]},{"name":"John Magaro","id":"770920855","characters":["Dean"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Josh Radnor"}],"studio":"IFC Films","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1872818"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1872818","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/liberal_arts/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771266121/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771266121/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771266121/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771266121.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
