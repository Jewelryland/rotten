In order to get back on his feet, Tommy moves in with his extended family, including his sister, Viki (Sigourney Weaver), a compulsive liar, and her husband, Ed (J.K. Simmons), a weatherworn cynic. Thanks to Viki, Tommy's grandmother thinks he's been in France the last few years. Now, as Tommy scrambles to get his life back together, his no-nonsense probation officer, Angela (Jeanne Tripplehorn), tracks his every move. Informed by his sister that his former girlfriend Christy (Julie Bowen) perished in a freak accident, Tommy goes to work flipping patties at Pirate Burger. Then, one day, Christy walks into the restaurant and it's like they were never apart -- aside from the fact that she's now engaged to marry Frank (Kelsey Grammer). Meanwhile, as Tommy's criminally inclined pal Gray (Ray Liotta) attempts to lure him back into a life of petty thievery, the confused ex-con begins to feel like he's falling for his probation officer. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/g1Mp9zwh44VbReXRaxkjez3TOp8=/53x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/50/11165000_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/g1Mp9zwh44VbReXRaxkjez3TOp8=/53x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/50/11165000_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/g1Mp9zwh44VbReXRaxkjez3TOp8=/53x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/50/11165000_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/g1Mp9zwh44VbReXRaxkjez3TOp8=/53x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/50/11165000_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Tim Allen","id":"162655909","characters":["Tommy"]},{"name":"Sigourney Weaver","id":"162660903","characters":["Viki"]},{"name":"Ray Liotta","id":"162669095","characters":["Gray"]},{"name":"J.K.
