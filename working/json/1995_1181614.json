An epic love story that spans childhood well into the young adult years, the film follows Heathcliff, a boy taken in by a benevolent Yorkshire farmer, Earnshaw. Living in Earnshaw's home, Heathcliff develops a passionate relationship with the farmer's teenage daughter, Catherine, inspiring the envy and mistrust of his son, Hindley. When Earnshaw passes away, the now-grown characters must finally confront the intense feelings and rivalries that have built up throughout their years together. -- (C) Oscilloscope","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/jkt3ZnmfvkjTzgWdYLJsUOG3ZTU=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/69/11166968_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/jkt3ZnmfvkjTzgWdYLJsUOG3ZTU=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/69/11166968_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/jkt3ZnmfvkjTzgWdYLJsUOG3ZTU=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/69/11166968_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/jkt3ZnmfvkjTzgWdYLJsUOG3ZTU=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/69/11166968_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"James Howson","id":"771094033","characters":["Older Heathcliff"]},{"name":"Kaya Scodelario","id":"770803276","characters":["Older Cathy"]},{"name":"Steve Evets","id":"770822533","characters":["Joseph"]},{"name":"Nichola Burley","id":"351526416","characters":["Isabella Linton"]},{"name":"Oliver Milburn","id":"364662384","characters":["Mr. Linton"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Andrea Arnold"}],"studio":"Oscilloscope Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1181614"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1181614","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wuthering_heights_2011/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771229019/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771229019/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771229019/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771229019.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
