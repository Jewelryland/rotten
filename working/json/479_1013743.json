June Havens (Cameron Diaz) is preparing to board a flight back home for her sister's wedding when she literally bumps into Roy Miller (Tom Cruise) in the middle of a busy airport. A few minutes later, they're making small talk on the plane when June excuses herself to the bathroom, and all hell breaks loose in the fuselage. By the time June emerges Roy has killed everybody on board, including the pilots. After crash-landing the plane in a darkened cornfield, Roy tells June that she should expect a visit from government agents, but warns her that by cooperating with them she risks almost certain death. The following day, Roy's prediction comes true when June is confronted by an imposing gang of government spooks who come under heavy fire while bombarding her with questions about her mysterious traveling companion. Suddenly, Roy is back, and he's once again whisking June away to safety. But what do the agents want, and why do they insist that Roy is the one to be feared, and not them? Before long the girl who never traveled far from home is off on a wild adventure that will take her from the tropics to Austria, France, and Spain. Somewhere amidst all of the confusion and gunfire, June begins to forge a bond with Roy. Unfortunately, it's never quite clear whether her unpredictable protector is one of the good guys or the bad guys, and by the time Roy reveals that he's attempting to protect a valuable new energy source, there's no time for questions. Paul Dano, Viola Davis, Peter Sarsgaard, Maggie Grace, and Marc Blucas co-star.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/qGEsMKuak7dGoRQ_XiHq_Lj0DOQ=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/91/11189198_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/qGEsMKuak7dGoRQ_XiHq_Lj0DOQ=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/91/11189198_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/qGEsMKuak7dGoRQ_XiHq_Lj0DOQ=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/91/11189198_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/qGEsMKuak7dGoRQ_XiHq_Lj0DOQ=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/91/11189198_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Tom Cruise","id":"162652763","characters":["Roy Miller"]},{"name":"Cameron Diaz","id":"162654443","characters":["June Havens"]},{"name":"Peter Sarsgaard","id":"162653220","characters":["Fitzgerald"]},{"name":"Jordi Molla","id":"364617086","characters":["Antonio"]},{"name":"Viola Davis","id":"162655119","characters":["Director George"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"James Mangold"}],"studio":"20th Century Fox","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1013743"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1013743","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/knight_and_day/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770820013/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770820013/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770820013/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770820013.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
