After embarking on a passionate affair with his evangelical neighbor's wife (Tyler), Gavin (Sons of Anarchy's Hunnam) soon finds himself in a battle of wills that will have life or death consequences. As a nonbeliever, Gavin is lured by her lover's husband (Insidious's Wilson) to the ledge of a high rise and told he has one hour to make a choice between his life or the one he loves. Without faith in an afterlife, will he be able to make a decision? It's up to police officer Hollis (Howard) to save both their lives, but the clock is ticking in this edge-of-your-seat film that will leave you gasping until the final frame. -- (C) IFC Films","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/15/74/11157426_tmb.jpg","profile":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/15/74/11157426_tmb.jpg","detailed":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/15/74/11157426_tmb.jpg","original":"http://content8.flixster.com/movie/11/15/74/11157426_tmb.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Charlie Hunnam","id":"162653833","characters":["Gavin Nichols"]},{"name":"Terrence Howard","id":"162652991","characters":["Hollis Lucetti"]},{"name":"Liv Tyler","id":"162661412","characters":["Shana"]},{"name":"Jacqueline Fleming","id":"770781003","characters":["Angela Lucetti"]},{"name":"Christopher Gorham","id":"162667590","characters":["Chris"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Matthew Chapman"}],"studio":"IFC Films","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1535970"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1535970","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_ledge/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771224179/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771224179/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771224179/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771224179.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
