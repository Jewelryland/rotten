He wakes up trapped in the dark, cramped trunk of a moving car with no recollection of how or why he's there. The only light comes from the blood-red digital numbers ticking away above his head that signify one thing..he's running out of time. As the captors reveal themselves and their motives while torturing their hostage mentally and physically, Jeremy realizes he is a pawn in their potentially catastrophic plot. He will not be set free until he gives up information about the President he's been trained not to reveal. -- (C) IFC","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/lwVoktOEkEqFSTEK1AZ-K4_pf5U=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/40/11164028_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/lwVoktOEkEqFSTEK1AZ-K4_pf5U=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/40/11164028_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/lwVoktOEkEqFSTEK1AZ-K4_pf5U=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/40/11164028_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/lwVoktOEkEqFSTEK1AZ-K4_pf5U=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/40/11164028_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Stephen Dorff","id":"162666782","characters":["Jeremy Reins"]},{"name":"Chyler Leigh","id":"162709860","characters":["Molly Reins"]},{"name":"Tom Berenger","id":"162660008","characters":["Ben Reynolds"]},{"name":"Sammy Sheik","id":"770806587","characters":["Marco"]},{"name":"Stephen Bridgewater","id":"298588444","characters":["Training Agent McClane"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Gabe Torres"}],"studio":"IFC Films","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1990181"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1990181","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/brake/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771267592/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771267592/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771267592/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771267592.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
