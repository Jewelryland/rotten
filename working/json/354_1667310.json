When a car accident leaves their wheel man and a state trooper dead, they split up and make a run for the Canadian border in the worst of circumstances - a near whiteout blizzard. While Addison heads cross-country, creating mayhem in his wake, Liza is picked up by ex-boxer Jay (Charlie Hunnam), en-route for a Thanksgiving homecoming with his parents, June (Sissy Spacek) and retired sheriff Chet (Kris Kristofferson). It's there the siblings are reunited in a terse and thrilling showdown that pushes the bonds of family to the limit. -- (C) Magnolia","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/czC4Ih1nbbr6o5ACmLvQeImadZY=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/27/11172745_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/czC4Ih1nbbr6o5ACmLvQeImadZY=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/27/11172745_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/czC4Ih1nbbr6o5ACmLvQeImadZY=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/27/11172745_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/czC4Ih1nbbr6o5ACmLvQeImadZY=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/27/11172745_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Eric Bana","id":"162662190","characters":["Addison"]},{"name":"Olivia Wilde","id":"326299741","characters":["Liza"]},{"name":"Kris Kristofferson","id":"162654718","characters":["Chet Mills"]},{"name":"Sissy Spacek","id":"162654735","characters":["June Mills"]},{"name":"Charlie Hunnam","id":"162653833","characters":["Jay Mills"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Stefan Ruzowitzky"}],"studio":"Magnolia Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1667310"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1667310","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/deadfall_2012/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771305730/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771305730/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771305730/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771305730.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
