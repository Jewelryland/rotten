Two policemen must join forces to take on an international drug- smuggling gang - one, an unorthodox Irish policeman and the other, a straitlaced FBI agent. Sergeant Gerry Boyle (Brendan Gleason) is an eccentric small-town cop with a confrontational and crass personality and a subversive sense of humor. A longtime policeman in County Galway, Boyle is a maverick with his own moral code. He has seen enough of the world to know there isn't much to it and has had plenty of time to think about it. When a fellow police officer disappears and Boyle's small town becomes key to a large drug trafficking investigation, he is forced to at least feign interest when dealing with the humorless FBI agent Wendell Everett (Don Cheadle) assigned to the case. -- (C) Sony Pictures","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Svs1n_60mhGtSBZc4HTz6DzZjiA=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/84/11158465_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Svs1n_60mhGtSBZc4HTz6DzZjiA=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/84/11158465_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Svs1n_60mhGtSBZc4HTz6DzZjiA=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/84/11158465_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Svs1n_60mhGtSBZc4HTz6DzZjiA=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/84/11158465_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Brendan Gleeson","id":"162652243","characters":["Gerry Boyle"]},{"name":"Don Cheadle","id":"162652206","characters":["Wendell Everett"]},{"name":"Rory Keenan","id":"770721099","characters":["Aidan McBride"]},{"name":"Liam Cunningham","id":"326433925","characters":["Francis Sheehy-Skeffington"]},{"name":"David Wilmot","id":"770698202","characters":["Liam O'Leary"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"John Michael McDonagh"}],"studio":"Sony Pictures Classics","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1540133"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1540133","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_guard_2011/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771225872/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771225872/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771225872/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771225872.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
