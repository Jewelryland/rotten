Hall), who is clamped firmly in the jaws of New York City inertia. He wants to travel but has no money; he needs a job but has no prospects; and he still shares an apartment with his widowed father (Peter Fonda), who treats Morris with a mix of disdain and exasperation. When he finds himself juggling a bizarre relationship with the sexually precocious 18-year-old daughter (Brie Larson) of a former classmate and the advances of his very forward neighbor (Lucy Liu), Morris realizes that even though his life is unraveling, it's also opening up in ways that are long overdue. -- (C) Official Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/J9JhvbaELzjcZ-ubN1V40QkaKVo=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/37/11163747_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/J9JhvbaELzjcZ-ubN1V40QkaKVo=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/37/11163747_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/J9JhvbaELzjcZ-ubN1V40QkaKVo=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/37/11163747_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/J9JhvbaELzjcZ-ubN1V40QkaKVo=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/37/11163747_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Michael C.
