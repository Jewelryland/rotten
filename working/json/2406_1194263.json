Few folks have spoken with Felix Bush (Duvall) since he disappeared into the Tennessee woods 40 years ago, and the ones who have don't necessarily have the kindest things to say about him. Gruff, confrontational, and ill-tempered, Felix has been the source of many malicious rumors over the years. Some say he's a cold-hearted killer and his penchant for walking into town with a shotgun, a wild beard, and threadbare clothes doesn't exactly give the impression of a man who seeks to make friends. When Felix walks into Frank Quinn's (Murray) funeral parlor and announces his intentions to throw himself a massive party before he passes away, word quickly spreads through town and anticipation starts to run high. Before long the big day has finally arrived, and Felix surprises everyone by revealing exactly why he shunned society to lead a life of solitude in the deep woods. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/XmQkTsoX1caG3OpEoLH5GW-z7lc=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/14/76/11147635_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/XmQkTsoX1caG3OpEoLH5GW-z7lc=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/14/76/11147635_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/XmQkTsoX1caG3OpEoLH5GW-z7lc=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/14/76/11147635_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/XmQkTsoX1caG3OpEoLH5GW-z7lc=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/14/76/11147635_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Robert Duvall","id":"162652186","characters":["Felix \"Bush\" Breazeale","Felix Bush"]},{"name":"Bill Murray","id":"162653064","characters":["Frank Quinn"]},{"name":"Sissy Spacek","id":"162654735","characters":["Mattie Darrow"]},{"name":"Lucas Black","id":"162655032","characters":["Buddy"]},{"name":"Gerald McRaney","id":"646801631","characters":["Rev.
