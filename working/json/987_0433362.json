The year is 2017, and a vampire plague has turned most of the planet's human population into bloodsucking ghouls. As the population of mortals fast begins to dwindle, a vampiric corporation sets out to capture and farm every remaining human while simultaneously researching a consumable blood substitute, headed by undead hematologist Edward Dalton (Ethan Hawke). His work is interrupted after stumbling onto a pocket of human survivors lead by Elvis (Willem Dafoe), a former vampire, whose past reveals a cure that could reverse the tide and save the human race. With time running out, Dalton's only hope lies in outsmarting the security forces of his boss (Sam Neill), whose goal isn't just to find a substitute, but to repopulate humanity in order to sell its blood to the highest bidder. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/fQf7wHXOD7_hEFhqw5SuhSeatXY=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/37/11173702_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/fQf7wHXOD7_hEFhqw5SuhSeatXY=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/37/11173702_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/fQf7wHXOD7_hEFhqw5SuhSeatXY=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/37/11173702_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/fQf7wHXOD7_hEFhqw5SuhSeatXY=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/37/11173702_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Ethan Hawke","id":"162660464","characters":["Edward Dalton"]},{"name":"Willem Dafoe","id":"162668400","characters":["Lionel 'Elvis' Cormac"]},{"name":"Isabel Lucas","id":"770794756","characters":["Alison Bromley"]},{"name":"Sam Neill","id":"162656850","characters":["Charles Bromley"]},{"name":"Vince Colosimo","id":"168449868","characters":["Christopher Caruso"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Peter Spierig"},{"name":"Michael Spierig"}],"studio":"Lionsgate","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"0433362"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=0433362","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/daybreakers/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770783685/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770783685/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770783685/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770783685.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
