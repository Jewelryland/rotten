Alfie (Anthony Hopkins) and Helena (Gemma Jones) have been married for years. They have a grown-up daughter named Sally (Naomi Watts), who is married to a successful novelist named Roy (Josh Brolin), but finds the future of her marriage in jeopardy after falling for Greg (Antonio Banderas), the dapper owner of a prominent art gallery. Meanwhile, as Roy develops a fixation on Dia (Freida Pinto), an exotic beauty he encounters on the street, Alfie ditches Helena for Charmaine (Lucy Punch), an impressionable young call girl. Now it seems that the harder everyone tries runs away from their problems, the faster their lives seem to fall apart. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/tomtB7VwDUT8_yxWXKjDCrY-12U=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/57/11155706_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/tomtB7VwDUT8_yxWXKjDCrY-12U=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/57/11155706_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/tomtB7VwDUT8_yxWXKjDCrY-12U=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/57/11155706_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/tomtB7VwDUT8_yxWXKjDCrY-12U=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/57/11155706_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Naomi Watts","id":"162654749","characters":["Sally"]},{"name":"Anthony Hopkins","id":"162653967","characters":["Alfie"]},{"name":"Josh Brolin","id":"162654237","characters":["Roy"]},{"name":"Gemma Jones","id":"309945690","characters":["Helena"]},{"name":"Freida Pinto","id":"770799097","characters":["Dia"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Woody Allen"}],"studio":"Sony Pictures Classics","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1182350"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1182350","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/you_will_meet_a_tall_dark_stranger/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770874814/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770874814/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770874814/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770874814.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
