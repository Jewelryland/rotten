Just one operative has been awarded 16 purple hearts, 3 Congressional Medals of Honor and 7 presidential medals of bravery. And only one guy is man enough to still sport a mullet. In the 10 years since his fiancee was killed, special op MacGruber has sworn off a life of fighting crime with his bare hands. But when he learns that his country needs him to find a nuclear warhead that's been stolen by his sworn enemy, Dieter Von Cunth, MacGruber figures he's the only one tough enough for the job. Assembling an elite team of experts--Lt. Dixon Piper and Vicki St. Elmo--MacGruber will navigate an army of assassins to hunt down Cunth and bring him to justice. His methods may be unorthodox. His crime scenes may get messy. But if you want the world saved right, you call in MacGruber.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/IcvZcx2iw0DLwx-WYf936UgnMFY=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/12/18/11121839_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/IcvZcx2iw0DLwx-WYf936UgnMFY=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/12/18/11121839_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/IcvZcx2iw0DLwx-WYf936UgnMFY=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/12/18/11121839_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/IcvZcx2iw0DLwx-WYf936UgnMFY=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/12/18/11121839_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Will Forte","id":"770670480","characters":["MacGruber"]},{"name":"Kristen Wiig","id":"770670481","characters":["Vicki St. Elmo"]},{"name":"Ryan Phillippe","id":"162676004","characters":["Lieutenant Dixon Piper"]},{"name":"Powers Boothe","id":"162691481","characters":["Colonel Faith"]},{"name":"Maya Rudolph","id":"306548951","characters":["Casey"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Jorma Taccone"}],"studio":"Universal/Rogue Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1470023"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1470023","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/macGruber/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770814361/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770814361/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770814361/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770814361.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
