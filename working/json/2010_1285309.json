Steve (David Duchovny) and Kate Jones (Demi Moore) have everything a happily married couple could ever want: their kids, Jenn (Amber Heard) and Mick (Ben Hollingsworth), are intelligent and attractive, they live in an affluent neighborhood, and their sprawling suburban home is jam-packed with all of the coolest gizmos and gadgets that money can buy. It isn't long before the Joneses have struck up a friendship with their next-door neighbors Larry (Gary Cole) and Summer (Glenne Headly), and become integral components of their community. But take a closer look at the situation and you'll start to see something ominous lurking just beneath the surface. It's only when the Joneses are confronted with an unexpected disaster that they finally discover who they really are beneath the glossy veneer of consumerism. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/317mGW-YiXhdBCIpjSGWmfLJOsU=/53x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/49/11164949_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/317mGW-YiXhdBCIpjSGWmfLJOsU=/53x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/49/11164949_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/317mGW-YiXhdBCIpjSGWmfLJOsU=/53x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/49/11164949_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/317mGW-YiXhdBCIpjSGWmfLJOsU=/53x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/49/11164949_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"David Duchovny","id":"162661591","characters":["Steve Jones"]},{"name":"Demi Moore","id":"162660862","characters":["Kate Jones"]},{"name":"Amber Heard","id":"770673718","characters":["Jenn Jones"]},{"name":"Benjamin Hollingsworth","id":"771062953","characters":["Mick Jones"]},{"name":"Gary Cole","id":"162678007","characters":["Larry"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Derrick Borte"}],"studio":"Roadside Attractions","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1285309"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1285309","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/joneses/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770815795/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770815795/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770815795/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770815795.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
