Now nothing but a small-time promoter, Charlie earns just enough money piecing together low-end bots from scrap metal to get from one underground boxing venue to the next. When Charlie hits rock bottom, he reluctantly teams up with his estranged son Max (Dakota Goyo) to build and train a championship contender. As the stakes in the brutal, no-holds-barred arena are raised, Charlie and Max, against all odds, get one last shot at a comeback. -- (C) Dreamworks","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/7oIWY0MvYql3m8_Eyf8yYdG9X9M=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/02/11160273_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/7oIWY0MvYql3m8_Eyf8yYdG9X9M=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/02/11160273_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/7oIWY0MvYql3m8_Eyf8yYdG9X9M=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/02/11160273_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/7oIWY0MvYql3m8_Eyf8yYdG9X9M=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/02/11160273_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Hugh Jackman","id":"162661503","characters":["Charlie Kenton"]},{"name":"Dakota Goyo","id":"528367055","characters":["Max"]},{"name":"Anthony Mackie","id":"162653786","characters":["Finn"]},{"name":"Evangeline Lilly","id":"512423472","characters":["Bailey Tallet"]},{"name":"Kevin Durand","id":"684288210","characters":["Ricky"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Shawn Levy"}],"studio":"Walt Disney Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"0433035"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=0433035","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/real_steel/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770858177/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770858177/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770858177/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770858177.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
