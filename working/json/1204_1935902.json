Based on the comic book, The Brass Teapot is a feature film about John (Michael Angarano) and Alice (Juno Temple), who live in small down America. They are in their 20's, married, very much in love and broke. Once voted \"Most Likely to Succeed,\" Alice struggles to make ends meet while her friends enjoy the good life. Her husband John, neurotic and riddled with phobias, just wants to get the bills paid. But an accident leads them to a roadside antique shop where Alice is spontaneously drawn to a mysterious brass teapot. It isn't long before they realize that this is no ordinary teapot and that perhaps they have found the answer to all of their financial woes. The Brass Teapot is a magical comedy that reminds us to be careful what we wish for.
