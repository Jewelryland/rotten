Directed by CONOR MCHAHON (Dead Meat), the film enjoyed a hugely successful screening at this year's Frightfest and won TOTAL FILM's 'Best Death' Award. Jaded Richard Grindle is the sleaziest clown working the children's party circuit in Ireland. Arriving late to one birthday, his timing is off, the bratty kids a nightmare and a prank goes horribly wrong - he falls on a kitchen knife and goes to that Big Top in the sky. Years later the same nasty kids attend another more grown up bash. Little do they know, thanks to a black magic clown cult, Stitches will be the uninvited guest of honour seeking revenge on those responsible for his untimely death. Laughs and gore combine in this twisted tale which also sees some fantastic performances from its young and upcoming cast that includes; TOMMY KNIGHT (Doctor Who) and GEMMA-LEAH DEVEREUX (The Tudors).(c) Official Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/vb8HMkGvX_Q02fZeCf1U4B66cws=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/96/11169665_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/vb8HMkGvX_Q02fZeCf1U4B66cws=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/96/11169665_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/vb8HMkGvX_Q02fZeCf1U4B66cws=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/96/11169665_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/vb8HMkGvX_Q02fZeCf1U4B66cws=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/96/11169665_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Ross Noble","id":"632503754","characters":["Richard Grindle/Stitches"]},{"name":"Tommy Knight","id":"770840501","characters":["Tom"]},{"name":"Gemma-Leah Devereux","id":"771414669","characters":["Kate"]},{"name":"Shane Murray Corcoran","id":"771442102","characters":["Vinny"]},{"name":"Thommas Kane Byrnes","id":"771442103","characters":["Bulger"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Conor McMahon"}],"studio":"MPI Media Group/Dark Sky Films","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"2126362"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=2126362","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/stitches_2012/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771312113/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771312113/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771312113/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771312113.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
