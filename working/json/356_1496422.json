With the help of Ward's younger brother Jack (Zac Efron) and sultry death-row groupie Charlotte Bless (Nicole Kidman), the pair tries to prove violent swamp-dweller Hillary Van Wetter (John Cusack) was framed for the murder of a corrupt local sheriff. Based on the provocative bestselling novel by Pete Dexter (Mulholland Falls, Rush), The Paperboy peels back a sleepy small town's decades-old facade of Southern gentility to reveal a quagmire of evil as dark as a Florida bayou. -- (C) Official Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/vmLbWQJYS1weWDQihNdzXCbumlY=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/26/11172644_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/vmLbWQJYS1weWDQihNdzXCbumlY=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/26/11172644_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/vmLbWQJYS1weWDQihNdzXCbumlY=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/26/11172644_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/vmLbWQJYS1weWDQihNdzXCbumlY=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/26/11172644_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Matthew McConaughey","id":"162652350","characters":["Ward Jansen"]},{"name":"Zac Efron","id":"171852647","characters":["Jack Jansen"]},{"name":"Nicole Kidman","id":"162652279","characters":["Charlotte Bless"]},{"name":"John Cusack","id":"162652927","characters":["Hillary Van Wetter"]},{"name":"David Oyelowo","id":"162653706","characters":["Yardley Acheman"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Lee Daniels"}],"studio":"Millenium Films","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1496422"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1496422","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_paperboy_2012/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771247910/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771247910/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771247910/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771247910.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
