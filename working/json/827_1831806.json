In the wake of a massacre at a remote gas station, The Hamilton's monstrous secret gets out. Desperate, they set their sights on England, and change their name to The Thompsons. Meanwhile, with the youngest sibling Lenny suffering mortal wounds, Francis follows rumors of another family of vampires to a quaint pub in the English countryside. Though his intuition was correct, Francis failed to realize that his English counterparts are more powerful than he ever could have imagined. After taking Francis hostage in a test of his powers, however, they quickly free him, and offer sanctuary to the fugitive family. But their benevolent offer masks dark intentions, and as the rest of The Thompsons make their way to the secluded safe haven, the American predators finally learn how it feels to be the prey.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/DVRsVbXw-4Caais_bAHCYjqt49g=/54x74/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/80/11168065_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/DVRsVbXw-4Caais_bAHCYjqt49g=/54x74/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/80/11168065_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/DVRsVbXw-4Caais_bAHCYjqt49g=/54x74/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/80/11168065_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/DVRsVbXw-4Caais_bAHCYjqt49g=/54x74/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/80/11168065_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Cory Knauf","id":"399395894","characters":["Francis Hamilton"]},{"name":"Samuel Child","id":"399395895","characters":["David Hamilton"]},{"name":"Joseph McKelheer","id":"399395896","characters":["Wendell Hamilton"]},{"name":"Mackenzie Firgens","id":"351527234","characters":["Darlene Hamilton"]},{"name":"Ryan Hartwig","id":"771403722","characters":["Lenny Hamilton"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Mitchell Altieri"},{"name":"Phil Flores"}],"studio":"Xlrator Media","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1831806"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1831806","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_thompsons_2012/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771314056/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771314056/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771314056/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771314056.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
