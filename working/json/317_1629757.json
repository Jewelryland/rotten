When 15 year old Jay discovers that the mythic Mavericks surf break, one of the biggest waves on Earth, is not only real, but exists just miles from his Santa Cruz home, he enlists the help of local legend Frosty Hesson (played by Gerard Butler) to train him to survive it. As Jay and Frosty embark on their quest to accomplish the impossible, they form a unique friendship that transforms both their lives, and their quest to tame Mavericks becomes about far more than surfing. Chasing Mavericks was made with the help of some of the biggest names in the surfing world, and features some of the most mind-blowing real wave footage ever captured on film. -- (C) Official Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/H2VHtjkLG7BLriF3wF1RLEhYoZs=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/82/11168294_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/H2VHtjkLG7BLriF3wF1RLEhYoZs=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/82/11168294_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/H2VHtjkLG7BLriF3wF1RLEhYoZs=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/82/11168294_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/H2VHtjkLG7BLriF3wF1RLEhYoZs=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/82/11168294_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Gerard Butler","id":"162659102","characters":["Frosty Hesson"]},{"name":"Jonny Weston","id":"771403662","characters":["Jay Moriarty"]},{"name":"John Weston","id":"771187525","characters":["Jay Moriarty"]},{"name":"Elisabeth Shue","id":"162654719","characters":["Kristy Moriarity"]},{"name":"Abigail Spencer","id":"770729279","characters":["Brenda Hesson"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Curtis Hanson"},{"name":"Michael Apted"}],"studio":"20th Century Fox","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1629757"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1629757","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/chasing_mavericks/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771257653/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771257653/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771257653/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771257653.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
