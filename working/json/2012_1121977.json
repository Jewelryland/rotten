It's been years since Karen (Annette Bening) gave her daughter, Elizabeth, up for adoption, and the decision to abandon her child has always haunted her. Upon meeting laid-back Paco (Jimmy Smits), Karen permits her anxiety and mistrust to get the best of her. On the surface it appears that Elizabeth (Naomi Watts) is none the worse for never knowing her biological mother; she's a fast-talking lawyer who's just landed a high-profile job at a firm fronted by Paul (Samuel L. Jackson), though her unsavory penchant for exploiting others is about to blow up in her face. Meanwhile, maternal-minded baker Lucy (Kerry Washington) longs to experience the joys of motherhood, eventually deciding that adoption is the best bet to start a family with her husband, Joseph (David Ramsey). ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/0bxILidyW4-N-3JgF2lzVsALRgg=/54x78/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/99/11179903_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/0bxILidyW4-N-3JgF2lzVsALRgg=/54x78/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/99/11179903_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/0bxILidyW4-N-3JgF2lzVsALRgg=/54x78/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/99/11179903_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/0bxILidyW4-N-3JgF2lzVsALRgg=/54x78/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/99/11179903_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Naomi Watts","id":"162654749","characters":["Elizabeth"]},{"name":"Annette Bening","id":"162660402","characters":["Karen"]},{"name":"Kerry Washington","id":"162682773","characters":["Lucy"]},{"name":"Samuel L.
