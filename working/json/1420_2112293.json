An aging hipster in Brooklyn, he spends his days in aimless recreation with like-minded friends (\"Tim & Eric\" co-star Eric Wareheim, LCD Soundsystem frontman James Murphy and comedian Gregg Turkington a.k.a.\"Neil Hamburger\") in games of comic irreverence and mock sincerity. As Swanson grows restless of the safety a sheltered life offers him, he tests the limits of acceptable behavior, pushing the envelope in every way he can. Heidecker's deadpan delivery cleverly masks a deep desire for connection and sense in the modern world. The Comedy wears its name on its sleeve, but director Rick Alverson's powerful and provocative character study touches a darkness behind the humor that resonates with viewers long after the story ends.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/NTq4IsZPZ431tWt6o0FFPobCN1g=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/88/11168802_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/NTq4IsZPZ431tWt6o0FFPobCN1g=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/88/11168802_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/NTq4IsZPZ431tWt6o0FFPobCN1g=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/88/11168802_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/NTq4IsZPZ431tWt6o0FFPobCN1g=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/88/11168802_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Tim Heidecker","id":"770795692","characters":["Swanson"]},{"name":"Eric Wareheim","id":"770793534","characters":["Van Arman"]},{"name":"Jeffrey Jensen","id":"771403670","characters":["Cargill"]},{"name":"James Murphy","id":"770758332","characters":["Ben"]},{"name":"Kate Lyn Sheil","id":"770840701","characters":["Waitress"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Rick Alverson"},{"name":"R.
