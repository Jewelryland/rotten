His new assignment: guarding Katherine (Malin Akerman, Watchmen), a code operator at a top-secret remote CIA \"Numbers Station\" where encrypted messages are sent and received. When an elite team of heavily armed assailants lays siege to the station, Emerson and Katherine suddenly find themselves in a life-or-death struggle against an unknown enemy. With the station compromised and innocent lives at stake, they must stop the deadly plot before it's too late.
