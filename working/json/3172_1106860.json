Sam Phelan (Chris Hemsworth) was just driving down the street when his life changed in the blink of an eye. Now, Sam and his wife, Leslie (Victoria Profeta), will never have to worry about money again. They will, however, have to worry about Pyke Kubic (Sean Bean), a vicious criminal who has every intention of finding his lost cash. When Pyke discovers that Sam and Leslie have already spent a sizable portion of the loot, he hatches a plan to make them work off their debt by robbing stores. Realizing that the only way out of their mess is through the thick of it, the clean-cut couple begins their life of crime, sinking ever deeper down a spiraling pool of obligation and desperation. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Nn93X6tC-zK16dxZvoB6oSWsQs8=/54x74/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/10/89/46/10894663_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Nn93X6tC-zK16dxZvoB6oSWsQs8=/54x74/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/10/89/46/10894663_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Nn93X6tC-zK16dxZvoB6oSWsQs8=/54x74/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/10/89/46/10894663_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Nn93X6tC-zK16dxZvoB6oSWsQs8=/54x74/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/10/89/46/10894663_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Sean Bean","id":"162652874","characters":["Pyke Kubic"]},{"name":"Chris Hemsworth","id":"770829335","characters":["Sam Phelan"]},{"name":"Victoria Profeta","id":"770847991","characters":["Leslie Phelan"]},{"name":"Anthony Thekkek","id":"771080889","characters":["Bahadurjik Tejeenderpeet Singh"]},{"name":"Glenn Plummer","id":"162654921","characters":["Glen"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Stephen Milburn Anderson"},{"name":"Steve Anderson"}],"studio":"Roadside Attractions","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1106860"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1106860","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cah/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770813945/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770813945/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770813945/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770813945.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
