His marriage dissolving before his very eyes, a former Marine (Skarsgard) ruins his credit by gambling online as his wife (Paula Patton) strikes up an intimate relationship on a popular social networking site. When identity theft puts their life savings at risk, the couple tracks down the man (Michael Nyqvust) they believe is responsible for the crime. Meanwhile, an introverted teenage goth (Jonah Bobo) becomes the victim of a humiliating prank when his two biggest tormentors pose as the girl he likes, trick him into exposing his true identity online. When the prank leads to tragedy, the young victim's mother (Davis) is overwhelmed by grief as her husband (Bateman) explodes with rage. Later, an ambitious TV reporter's quest to expose an online prostitution racket has unexpected repercussions for the frightened young man at the center of the growing controversy. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/O0WF5Tc9Dj7PZLgVKoep1VwGJyY=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/34/11173488_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/O0WF5Tc9Dj7PZLgVKoep1VwGJyY=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/34/11173488_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/O0WF5Tc9Dj7PZLgVKoep1VwGJyY=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/34/11173488_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/O0WF5Tc9Dj7PZLgVKoep1VwGJyY=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/34/11173488_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Jason Bateman","id":"326298973","characters":["Rich Boyd"]},{"name":"Hope Davis","id":"162653969","characters":["Lydia Boyd"]},{"name":"Frank Grillo","id":"770679606","characters":["Mike Dixon"]},{"name":"Michael Nyqvist","id":"291428358","characters":["Stephen Schumacher"]},{"name":"Paula Patton","id":"326392480","characters":["Cindy Hull"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Henry Alex Rubin"}],"studio":"LD Entertainment","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1433811"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1433811","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/disconnect_2013/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771312103/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771312103/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771312103/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771312103.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
