Unfortunately, her life takes an unexpected turn when Jack and Emilia lose their newborn daughter. Emilia struggles through her grief to connect with her new stepson William (Charlie Tahan, I AM LEGEND), while also trying to overcome a long-standing rift in her relationship with her father caused by his own infidelity. But perhaps the most difficult obstacle of all for Emilia is trying to cope with the constant interferences of her husband's angry, jealous ex-wife, Carolyn (Lisa Kudrow, FRIENDS, ANALYZE THIS). Ultimately, Emilia's and Charlie's playful and sometimes tender exchanges help Emilia to open her heart. Can Emilia rediscover her own capacity for love in time to salvage her failing marriage, mend fences with her parents and build a family from the wreckage? Directed by Don Roos (THE OPPOSITE OF SEX) from his own screenplay, this tearful, terrific tale proves that even with a pursuit like love, nothing is impossible... -- (C) IFC Films","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Wrhrjj5HX4HgXvN6-Etg_l7mRCA=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/52/11155201_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Wrhrjj5HX4HgXvN6-Etg_l7mRCA=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/52/11155201_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Wrhrjj5HX4HgXvN6-Etg_l7mRCA=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/52/11155201_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Wrhrjj5HX4HgXvN6-Etg_l7mRCA=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/52/11155201_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Natalie Portman","id":"162652154","characters":["Emilia"]},{"name":"Lisa Kudrow","id":"162675442","characters":["Carolyn"]},{"name":"Scott Cohen","id":"351525103","characters":["Jack"]},{"name":"Charlie Tahan","id":"770670076","characters":["William"]},{"name":"Lauren Ambrose","id":"364612974","characters":["Mindy"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Don Roos"}],"studio":"IFC Films","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1032825"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1032825","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_other_woman_2011/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771220873/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771220873/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771220873/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771220873.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
