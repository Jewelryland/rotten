Against his wishes, Sam is called home, where he must put his father's estate in order and reconnect with his estranged family. In the course of fulfilling his father's last wishes, Sam uncovers a startling secret that turns his entire world upside down: He has a 30-year-old sister Frankie whom he never knew about (Elizabeth Banks). As their relationship develops, Sam is forced to rethink everything he thought he knew about his family-and re-examine his own life choices in the process. -- (C) Dreamworks","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/puDjarlHB_iFsdLEkhcdpbyIyZs=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/52/11165269_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/puDjarlHB_iFsdLEkhcdpbyIyZs=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/52/11165269_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/puDjarlHB_iFsdLEkhcdpbyIyZs=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/52/11165269_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/puDjarlHB_iFsdLEkhcdpbyIyZs=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/52/11165269_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Elizabeth Banks","id":"162653584","characters":["Frankie"]},{"name":"Chris Pine","id":"326393041","characters":["Sam"]},{"name":"Michael Hall D'Addario","id":"771402987","characters":["Josh"]},{"name":"Michelle Pfeiffer","id":"162660689","characters":["Lillian"]},{"name":"Olivia Wilde","id":"326299741","characters":["Hannah"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Alex Kurtzman"}],"studio":"Dreamworks Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1716777"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1716777","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/people_like_us_2012/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771272346/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771272346/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771272346/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771272346.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
