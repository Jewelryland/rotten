ParaNorman is, following Coraline, the company's second stop-motion animated feature to be made in 3D. In ParaNorman, a small town comes under siege by zombies. Who can it call? Only misunderstood local boy Norman (Kodi Smit-McPhee), who is able to speak with the dead. In addition to the zombies, he'll have to take on ghosts, witches and, worst, of all, grown-ups, to save his town from a centuries-old curse. But this young ghoul whisperer may find his paranormal activities pushed to their otherworldly limits. -- (C) Focus","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/OeNghbsGd--mY9T4S5eQWI-nHpQ=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/73/11167330_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/OeNghbsGd--mY9T4S5eQWI-nHpQ=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/73/11167330_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/OeNghbsGd--mY9T4S5eQWI-nHpQ=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/73/11167330_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/OeNghbsGd--mY9T4S5eQWI-nHpQ=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/73/11167330_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Kodi Smit-McPhee","id":"770673434","characters":["Norman Babcock"]},{"name":"Tucker Albrizzi","id":"771103443","characters":["Neil"]},{"name":"Casey Affleck","id":"162706324","characters":["Mitch"]},{"name":"Anna Kendrick","id":"528367112","characters":["Courtney"]},{"name":"Christopher Mintz-Plasse","id":"770679139","characters":["Alvin"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Chris Butler (XII)"},{"name":"Sam Fell"}],"studio":"Focus Features","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1623288"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1623288","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/paranorman/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771242305/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771242305/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771242305/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771242305.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
