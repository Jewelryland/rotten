As the young couple tentatively come together, breaking through layers and layers of awkwardness and low self-esteem, Clyde and Lucy's marriage begins to dissolve because of Clyde's inability to get over an incident from their past. All the while, Clyde gives Jack swimming lessons so that he can take Connie on her dream date -- a boating trip on the lake. ~ Perry Seibert, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/MzWN03QeX1wzY0wj2XTtbbi35zQ=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/07/11170798_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/MzWN03QeX1wzY0wj2XTtbbi35zQ=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/07/11170798_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/MzWN03QeX1wzY0wj2XTtbbi35zQ=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/07/11170798_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/MzWN03QeX1wzY0wj2XTtbbi35zQ=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/07/11170798_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Philip Seymour Hoffman","id":"162654287","characters":["Jack"]},{"name":"Amy Ryan","id":"162653858","characters":["Connie"]},{"name":"John Ortiz","id":"769772570","characters":["Clyde"]},{"name":"Daphne Rubin-Vega","id":"770714341","characters":["Lucy"]},{"name":"Tom McCarthy","id":"770898670","characters":["Dr. Bob"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Philip Seymour Hoffman"}],"studio":"Fox Searchlight","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1278379"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1278379","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jack_goes_boating/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770814193/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770814193/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770814193/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770814193.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
