Henry (Joseph Cross) was studying for his nursing degree when his father died unexpectedly. Realizing that the responsibility of caring for his family has fallen on his shoulders, Henry drops out of school and lands a job as a doorman at a posh Manhattan apartment building. Henry's boss (Joe Pantoliano) is an uptight bundle of nerves, and his co-worker (Snoop Dogg) is the dictionary definition of \"mellow.\" Instructed never to fraternize with the tenants, Henry can't help but fall in love with pretty Scarlet Downing (Sarah Roemer) following a chance meeting. When Henry's fired for breaking rule number one, he realizes that not everyone defines themselves by their social status, and that sometimes love is worth fighting for.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/-bnhuWgx07DpJYnMlFYzW4tD-4E=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/24/11182487_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/-bnhuWgx07DpJYnMlFYzW4tD-4E=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/24/11182487_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/-bnhuWgx07DpJYnMlFYzW4tD-4E=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/24/11182487_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/-bnhuWgx07DpJYnMlFYzW4tD-4E=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/24/11182487_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Joseph Cross","id":"162673235","characters":["Henry O'Shea"]},{"name":"Rachael Leigh Cook","id":"162666273","characters":["Caitlin O'Shea"]},{"name":"Sarah Roemer","id":"533332072","characters":["Scarlett Dowling"]},{"name":"Snoop Dogg","id":"162661723","characters":["Raul"]},{"name":"Mimi Rogers","id":"162676960","characters":["Meredith"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"David M.
