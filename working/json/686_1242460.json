Tilda Swinton, in a bracing, tour-de-force performance, plays the mother, Eva, as she contends for 15 years with the increasing malevolence of her first-born child, Kevin (Ezra Miller). Based on the best-selling novel of the same name, We Need to Talk About Kevin explores nature vs. nurture on a whole new level as Eva's own culpability is measured against Kevin's innate evilness. -- (C) Oscilloscope","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/AD75IHbSLU_ZR8byUObD3s98tdc=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/11/11161154_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/AD75IHbSLU_ZR8byUObD3s98tdc=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/11/11161154_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/AD75IHbSLU_ZR8byUObD3s98tdc=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/11/11161154_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/AD75IHbSLU_ZR8byUObD3s98tdc=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/11/11161154_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Tilda Swinton","id":"162654047","characters":["Eva"]},{"name":"John C.
