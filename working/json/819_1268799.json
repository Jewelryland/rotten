But when a mysterious package mistakenly arrives at Kumar's door on Christmas Eve, his attempt to redirect it to Harold's house ends with the \"high grade\" contents-and Harold's father-in-law's prize Christmas tree-going up in smoke. With his in-laws out of the house for the day, Harold decides to cover his tracks, rather than come clean. Reluctantly embarking on another ill-advised journey with Kumar through New York City, their search for the perfect replacement tree takes them through party heaven-and almost blows Christmas Eve sky high. -- (C) Warner Bros","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/LerQFdoWrbvRmfRFx_rRfMNK0os=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/36/11163672_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/LerQFdoWrbvRmfRFx_rRfMNK0os=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/36/11163672_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/LerQFdoWrbvRmfRFx_rRfMNK0os=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/36/11163672_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/LerQFdoWrbvRmfRFx_rRfMNK0os=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/36/11163672_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"John Cho","id":"300371277","characters":["Harold"]},{"name":"Kal Penn","id":"286538557","characters":["Kumar"]},{"name":"Neil Patrick Harris","id":"351527581","characters":["Neil Patrick Harris"]},{"name":"Patton Oswalt","id":"162655225","characters":["Mall Santa"]},{"name":"Danny Trejo","id":"358124392","characters":["Mr. Perez"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Todd Strauss-Schulson"}],"studio":"Warner Bros.
