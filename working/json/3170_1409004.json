Jackie Kirk (Sara Stouffer) spent most of her teenage years in the limelight; she was a member of the cast of Neptune 26, a popular sci-fi television series that enjoyed a six year run. But now that the show has been cancelled, eighteen-year-old Jackie simply wants to be inconspicuous, just another freshman psychology student at a university in Indiana. Thanks to Neptune 26's success, that's no simple task, and her celebrity alienates more of her fellow students than it attracts. Jackie is attending a mixer for psychology students and faculty when he meets Catherine Stark (Allison McAtee), an attractive and confident professor. Catherine makes no secret that she's attracted to Jackie, and Jackie eagerly responds in kind. Soon the two are having an affair, but their relationship does not go unnoticed by campus gossips. Word about their romance spreads following the announcement that a Neptune 26 feature film is going into production, making Jackie even more recognizable, and the couple find themselves subjected to the often harsh judgment of others. Bloomington was an official selection at the 2010 San Francisco International LGBT Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/YcLD8UH8bPgzEk7qyQqBNBKsl70=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/48/11154811_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/YcLD8UH8bPgzEk7qyQqBNBKsl70=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/48/11154811_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/YcLD8UH8bPgzEk7qyQqBNBKsl70=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/48/11154811_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/YcLD8UH8bPgzEk7qyQqBNBKsl70=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/48/11154811_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Sarah Stouffer","id":"771080979","characters":["Jackie"]},{"name":"Allison McAtee","id":"771086493"},{"name":"Katherine Ann McGregor","id":"771042547"},{"name":"Erika Heidewald","id":"771086494"},{"name":"Chelsea Rogers","id":"771086495"}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Fernanda Cardoso"}],"studio":"Cinetic","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1409004"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1409004","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bloomington_2010/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771223838/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771223838/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771223838/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771223838.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
