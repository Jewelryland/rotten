The story revolves around a legendary Warrior Priest (Paul Bettany) from the last Vampire War who now lives in obscurity among the other downtrodden human inhabitants in walled-in dystopian cities ruled by the Church. When his niece (Lily Collins) is abducted by a murderous pack of vampires, Priest breaks his sacred vows to venture out on an obsessive quest to find her before they turn her into one of them. -- (C) Sony","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/UobNGEGRgeWwc1rb72k51ydWOFo=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/63/11156350_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/UobNGEGRgeWwc1rb72k51ydWOFo=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/63/11156350_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/UobNGEGRgeWwc1rb72k51ydWOFo=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/63/11156350_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/UobNGEGRgeWwc1rb72k51ydWOFo=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/63/11156350_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Paul Bettany","id":"162660360","characters":["Priest"]},{"name":"Maggie Q","id":"397331134","characters":["Priestess"]},{"name":"Cam Gigandet","id":"770699333","characters":["Hicks"]},{"name":"Lily Collins","id":"770878598","characters":["Lucy"]},{"name":"Karl Urban","id":"162654704","characters":["Black Hat"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Scott Stewart"}],"studio":"Screen Gems/SONY PICTURES","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"0822847"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=0822847","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10009274-priest/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770682648/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770682648/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770682648/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770682648.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
