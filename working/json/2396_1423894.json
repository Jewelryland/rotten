The film spans three decades and two continents. There is his first wife, Clara, a flame-haired, flagrantly unfaithful free sprit. The \"Second Mrs. P.\" is a wealthy Jewish Princess who shops and talks incessantly. It is at their lavish wedding that Barney meets, and starts pursuing, Miriam, his third wife, the mother of his two children, and his true love. Not only does Barney turn out to be a true romantic, he is also capable of all kinds of sneaky acts of gallantry, generosity, and goodness. His is a gloriously full life, played out on a grand scale.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/LEkVnTVhWS4CGxL1RaMTumAaP08=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/44/11154466_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/LEkVnTVhWS4CGxL1RaMTumAaP08=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/44/11154466_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/LEkVnTVhWS4CGxL1RaMTumAaP08=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/44/11154466_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/LEkVnTVhWS4CGxL1RaMTumAaP08=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/44/11154466_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Paul Giamatti","id":"162683649","characters":["Barney Panofsky"]},{"name":"Dustin Hoffman","id":"162659372","characters":["Izzy Panofsky"]},{"name":"Rosamund Pike","id":"162654705","characters":["Miriam Grant-Panofsky"]},{"name":"Minnie Driver","id":"162656409","characters":["2nd Mrs. \"P\""]},{"name":"Rachelle Lefevre","id":"617031440","characters":["Clara"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Richard J.
