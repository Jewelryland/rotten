The three boys share the same father, but all have different mothers. Their father died a rich man and when they're brought together by their sister Nina (Amy Smart) to learn which one of them will inherit the old man's fortune, they are handed an unpleasant surprise. A requirement of the will is that the three estranged siblings go into business together as bail bondsmen. Their first job takes them into the mountains of Mexico where they encounter a drug lord and uncover a kidnapping plot, masterminded by an embittered entrepreneur (Michael Rispoli) that will endanger them all. -- (C) Samuel Goldwyn","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/06/11160657_tmb.jpg","profile":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/06/11160657_tmb.jpg","detailed":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/06/11160657_tmb.jpg","original":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/06/11160657_tmb.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"John Cena","id":"347990562","characters":["Sam Cleary"]},{"name":"Ethan Embry","id":"162664368","characters":["Leo Cleary"]},{"name":"Michael Rispoli","id":"770696986","characters":["Nicholas Canton"]},{"name":"Robert Boyd Holbrook","id":"771061616","characters":["Douglas Cleary"]},{"name":"Amy Smart","id":"162655491","characters":["Nina"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Michael Pavone"},{"name":"Mike Pavone"}],"studio":"Samuel Goldwyn Films","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1792543"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1792543","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blood_brothers_2011/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771252742/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771252742/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771252742/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771252742.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
