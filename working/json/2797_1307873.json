As Detective Cruz sets out to find her, the clues send him into the city's seediest corners, from a Hollywood action star with a dirty little secret (James Van Der Beek), to an enterprising porn producer who takes a personal interest in his own work (Snoop Dogg), and a kinky waitress with an unusual fetish for particle physics (Autumn Reeser). Lexie proves to be as elusive as she is beautiful and Cruz becomes obsessed with finding her. With time running out, Cruz discovers the trail leads to reclusive billionaire (Sam Elliott), and his physicist (Jimmi Simpson), intent on recreating The Big Bang underneath the New Mexico desert. Tailed by a trio of cops also looking to find the missing diamonds, and with the body count piling up, Cruz soon realizes that what appeared to be a standard missing person's case is anything but, and could quite possibly bring about the end of the world as we know it. --(c) Anchor Bay","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/1M4TXbjbcdNmPM2UDoqgXNYVMqw=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/65/11156549_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/1M4TXbjbcdNmPM2UDoqgXNYVMqw=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/65/11156549_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/1M4TXbjbcdNmPM2UDoqgXNYVMqw=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/65/11156549_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/1M4TXbjbcdNmPM2UDoqgXNYVMqw=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/65/11156549_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Antonio Banderas","id":"162654885","characters":["Ned Cruz"]},{"name":"Thomas Kretschmann","id":"162704480","characters":["Frizer"]},{"name":"William Fichtner","id":"162652209","characters":["Poley"]},{"name":"Sienna Guillory","id":"162686458","characters":["Julie Kestral/Lexie Persimmon"]},{"name":"James Van Der Beek","id":"162678054","characters":["Adam Nova"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Tony Krantz"}],"studio":"Independent Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1307873"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1307873","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_big_bang_2011/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771229710/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771229710/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771229710/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771229710.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
