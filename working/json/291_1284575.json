For example, there's Elizabeth (Cameron Diaz). She's foul-mouthed, ruthless, and inappropriate. She drinks, she gets high, and she can't wait to marry her meal ticket and get out of her bogus day job. When she's dumped by her fiance, she sets her plan in motion to win over a rich, handsome substitute (Justin Timberlake) - competing for his affections with an overly energetic colleague, Amy (Lucy Punch). When Elizabeth also finds herself fighting off the advances of a sarcastic, irreverent gym teacher (Jason Segel), the consequences of her wild and outrageous schemes give her students, her coworkers, and even herself an education like no other. -- (C) Sony Pictures","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/mldkG9FmAX5Xor0lqN_BK9uZqp0=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/61/11156194_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/mldkG9FmAX5Xor0lqN_BK9uZqp0=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/61/11156194_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/mldkG9FmAX5Xor0lqN_BK9uZqp0=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/61/11156194_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/mldkG9FmAX5Xor0lqN_BK9uZqp0=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/61/11156194_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Cameron Diaz","id":"162654443","characters":["Elizabeth Halsey"]},{"name":"Justin Timberlake","id":"246212645","characters":["Scott Delacorte"]},{"name":"Jason Segel","id":"770670222","characters":["Russell Gettis"]},{"name":"Lucy Punch","id":"510743072","characters":["Amy Squirrel"]},{"name":"John Michael Higgins","id":"162655101","characters":["Principal Wally Snur"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Jake Kasdan"}],"studio":"Sony Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1284575"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1284575","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bad_teacher/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771030879/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771030879/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771030879/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771030879.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
