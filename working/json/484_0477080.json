In order to save the day, they must figure out how to catch up to the rogue engine, and stop it before harm comes to the town. Standing in their way is Galvin (Kevin Dunn), the head of the company who is more interested in saving the stock price than lives. On the plus side, the duo have competent corporate employee Connie (Rosario Dawson) on the radio, talking them through their various attempts to corral and then stop the potentially lethal locomotive. ~ Perry Seibert, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/qUSYGKJiJCeAF6lPhx5B1RCDymo=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/82/11178250_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/qUSYGKJiJCeAF6lPhx5B1RCDymo=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/82/11178250_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/qUSYGKJiJCeAF6lPhx5B1RCDymo=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/82/11178250_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/qUSYGKJiJCeAF6lPhx5B1RCDymo=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/82/11178250_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Denzel Washington","id":"162661439","characters":["Frank"]},{"name":"Chris Pine","id":"326393041","characters":["Will"]},{"name":"Rosario Dawson","id":"162665341","characters":["Connie"]},{"name":"Ethan Suplee","id":"357005912","characters":["Dewey"]},{"name":"Kevin Dunn","id":"162664658","characters":["Galvin"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Tony Scott"}],"studio":"20th Century Fox","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"0477080"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=0477080","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/unstoppable-2010/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770814364/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770814364/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770814364/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770814364.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
