Like all little people, Arrietty (AIR-ee-ett-ee) remains hidden from view, except during occasional covert ventures beyond the floorboards to \"borrow\" scrap supplies like sugar cubes from her human hosts. But when 12-year-old Shawn (David Henrie), a human boy who comes to stay in the home, discovers his mysterious housemate one evening, a secret friendship blossoms. If discovered, their relationship could drive Arrietty's family from the home and straight into danger. -- (C) Disney","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/pYwfgjOSNO96yJeLumI6aOS7ZzA=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/10/11161029_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/pYwfgjOSNO96yJeLumI6aOS7ZzA=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/10/11161029_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/pYwfgjOSNO96yJeLumI6aOS7ZzA=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/10/11161029_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/pYwfgjOSNO96yJeLumI6aOS7ZzA=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/10/11161029_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Bridgit Mendler","id":"770797252","characters":["Arrietty"]},{"name":"Amy Poehler","id":"162672465","characters":["Homily"]},{"name":"Will Arnett","id":"335717464","characters":["Pod"]},{"name":"Carol Burnett","id":"162661407","characters":["Hara"]},{"name":"David Henrie","id":"699055003","characters":["Shawn"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Hiromasa Yonebayashi"},{"name":"Atsushi Okui"}],"studio":"Walt Disney Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1568921"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1568921","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_secret_world_of_arrietty/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771221507/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771221507/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771221507/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771221507.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
