Soon Eddie takes Wall Street by storm, parlaying a small stake into millions. His accomplishments catch the eye of mega-mogul Carl Van Loon (De Niro),who invites him to help broker the largest merger in corporate history. But they also bring Eddie to the attention of people willing to do anything to get their hands on his stash of NZT. With his life in jeopardy and the drug's brutal side effects grinding him down, Eddie dodges mysterious stalkers, a vicious gangster and an intense police investigation as he attempts to hang on to his dwindling supply long enough to outwit his enemies.-- (C) Relativity","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/ilFQo8IIbtbOfRww689juriXt4Q=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/61/11156184_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/ilFQo8IIbtbOfRww689juriXt4Q=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/61/11156184_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/ilFQo8IIbtbOfRww689juriXt4Q=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/61/11156184_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/ilFQo8IIbtbOfRww689juriXt4Q=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/61/11156184_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Bradley Cooper","id":"351525448","characters":["Eddie Morra"]},{"name":"Robert De Niro","id":"162655521","characters":["Carl Van Loon"]},{"name":"Abbie Cornish","id":"286584167","characters":["Lindy"]},{"name":"Andrew Howard","id":"770688393","characters":["Gennady"]},{"name":"Anna Friel","id":"162714834","characters":["Melissa"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Neil Burger"}],"studio":"Relativity Media","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1219289"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1219289","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/limitless/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771036677/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771036677/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771036677/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771036677.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
