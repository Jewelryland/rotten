Schultz is on the trail of the murderous Brittle brothers, and only Django can lead him to his bounty. Honing vital hunting skills, Django remains focused on one goal: finding and rescuing Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), the wife he lost to the slave trade long ago. Django and Schultz's search ultimately leads them to Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), the proprietor of \"Candyland,\" an infamous plantation. Exploring the compound under false pretenses, Django and Schultz arouse the suspicion of Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson), Candie's trusted house slave. -- (C) Weinstein","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/dpW9o9AdWfecHLSirgUGwaoOhCA=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/17/11171702_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/dpW9o9AdWfecHLSirgUGwaoOhCA=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/17/11171702_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/dpW9o9AdWfecHLSirgUGwaoOhCA=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/17/11171702_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/dpW9o9AdWfecHLSirgUGwaoOhCA=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/17/11171702_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Jamie Foxx","id":"162652975","characters":["Django"]},{"name":"Christoph Waltz","id":"770738334","characters":["Dr. King Schultz"]},{"name":"Leonardo DiCaprio","id":"162659161","characters":["Calvin Candie"]},{"name":"Samuel L.
