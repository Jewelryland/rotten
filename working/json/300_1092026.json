While there, they accidentally meet an alien who brings them on an insane road trip that alters their universe forever. For the past 60 years, an alien named Paul (Seth Rogen) has been hanging out at a top-secret military base. For reasons unknown, the space-traveling smart ass decides to escape the compound and hop on the first vehicle out of town -- a rented RV containing Earthlings Graeme Willy (Pegg) and Clive Gollings (Frost). Chased by federal agents and the fanatical father of a young woman that they accidentally kidnap, Graeme and Clive hatch a fumbling escape plan to return Paul to his mother ship. And as two nerds struggle to help, one little green man might just take his fellow outcasts from misfits to intergalactic heroes. Paul is directed by Superbad's Greg Mottola, from a story by Pegg & Frost. Joining the comedy's cast are Jason Bateman, Kristen Wiig, Bill Hader, Blythe Danner, Joe Lo Truglio, John Carroll Lynch, David Koechner and Sigourney Weaver. -- (C) Universal","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/tvVdC0ucDfZLF0qJ69wRQdpC19Y=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/42/11154277_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/tvVdC0ucDfZLF0qJ69wRQdpC19Y=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/42/11154277_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/tvVdC0ucDfZLF0qJ69wRQdpC19Y=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/42/11154277_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/tvVdC0ucDfZLF0qJ69wRQdpC19Y=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/42/11154277_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Simon Pegg","id":"162684057","characters":["Graeme Willy"]},{"name":"Nick Frost","id":"162684059","characters":["Clive Gollings"]},{"name":"Jason Bateman","id":"326298973","characters":["Agent Zoil"]},{"name":"Kristen Wiig","id":"770670481","characters":["Ruth Buggs"]},{"name":"Bill Hader","id":"742790769","characters":["Haggard"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Greg Mottola"}],"studio":"Universal Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1092026"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1092026","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/paul/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770788767/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770788767/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770788767/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770788767.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
