What could be better? Enter Roger Dawson. Roger has nothing. No friends. No hope. Nothing but putdowns and getting pushed aside. Things couldn't get worse...could they? Jake and Roger were best friends when they were kids. But the politics of high school quickly pulled them apart. Now Roger doesn't fit in Jake's - or anyone's circle - and he's had enough. He walks onto campus with a gun in his pocket and pain in his heart and makes a tragic move. Jake's last-ditch effort can't stop Roger, and the sudden tragedy rocks Jake's world.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/YrgXyOkPo4UOZywhtvizld9N56M=/54x72/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/10/92/76/10927693_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/YrgXyOkPo4UOZywhtvizld9N56M=/54x72/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/10/92/76/10927693_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/YrgXyOkPo4UOZywhtvizld9N56M=/54x72/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/10/92/76/10927693_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/YrgXyOkPo4UOZywhtvizld9N56M=/54x72/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/10/92/76/10927693_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Randy Wayne","id":"575674613","characters":["Jake Taylor"]},{"name":"Deja Kreutzberg","id":"770830251","characters":["Amy Briggs"]},{"name":"Joshua Weigel","id":"770835240","characters":["Chris"]},{"name":"Kim Hidalgo","id":"770811506","characters":["Andrea"]},{"name":"Sean Michael Afable","id":"770875165","characters":["Jonny"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Brian Baugh"},{"name":"Bryan Baugh"}],"studio":"IDP/Samuel goldwyn Films","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1270286"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1270286","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/to_save_a_life/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770806389/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770806389/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770806389/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770806389.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
