Nine-year-old Milo (Seth Green) finds out just how much he needs his mom (Joan Cusack) when she's nabbed by Martians who plan to steal her mom-ness for their own young. Produced by the team behind Disney's A Christmas Carol and The Polar Express, Mars Needs Moms showcases Milo's quest to save his mom-a wild adventure in 3D that involves stowing away on a spaceship, navigating an elaborate, multi-level planet and taking on the alien nation and their leader (Mindy Sterling). With the help of a tech-savvy, underground earthman named Gribble (Dan Fogler) and a rebel Martian girl called Ki (Elisabeth Harnois), Milo just might find his way back to his mom-in more ways than one. Based on the Book by Berkeley Breathed. -- (C) Disney","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/ca6OYEK8Gqugo6V7o8gab_pM6J0=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/37/11153700_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/ca6OYEK8Gqugo6V7o8gab_pM6J0=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/37/11153700_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/ca6OYEK8Gqugo6V7o8gab_pM6J0=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/37/11153700_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/ca6OYEK8Gqugo6V7o8gab_pM6J0=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/37/11153700_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Seth Green","id":"162660883","characters":["Milo"]},{"name":"Dan Fogler","id":"326396240","characters":["Gribble"]},{"name":"Elisabeth Harnois","id":"381421553","characters":["Ki"]},{"name":"Joan Cusack","id":"162655020","characters":["Mom"]},{"name":"Mindy Sterling","id":"347990426","characters":["Supervisor"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Simon Wells"}],"studio":"Walt Disney Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1305591"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1305591","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mars_needs_moms/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770873458/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770873458/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770873458/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770873458.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
