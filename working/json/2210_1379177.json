They bind and gag her and take her to an abandoned, soundproofed apartment. She is Alice Creed, daughter of a millionaire. Her kidnappers, the coldly efficient Vic and his younger accomplice Danny, have worked out a meticulous plan. But, Alice is not going to play the perfect victim -- she's not giving in without a fight. In a tense power-play of greed, duplicity and survival we discover that sometimes disappearances can be deceptive.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/zm79nGtzKZ0uAYi0Brm50BW-_e4=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/12/11151266_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/zm79nGtzKZ0uAYi0Brm50BW-_e4=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/12/11151266_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/zm79nGtzKZ0uAYi0Brm50BW-_e4=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/12/11151266_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/zm79nGtzKZ0uAYi0Brm50BW-_e4=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/12/11151266_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Gemma Arterton","id":"770692644","characters":["Alice Creed"]},{"name":"Martin Compston","id":"162734446","characters":["Danny"]},{"name":"Eddie Marsan","id":"326392524","characters":["Vic"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"J Blakeson"}],"studio":"Anchor Bay Entertainment","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1379177"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1379177","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/disappearance_of_alice_creed/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770817239/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770817239/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770817239/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770817239.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
