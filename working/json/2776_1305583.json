When they return from college and suddenly announce their marriage plans, they discover that their competitive and egotistical fathers can wreak serious havoc on their special day. With insults flying and tempers running high, it's anyone's guess if the alpha dads will survive to make it down the aisle. Lucia's mother is planning \"her\" dream wedding and the only levelheaded one in the bunch is Angela, the groom's father's best friend and lawyer. With only weeks to plan their wedding, Lucia and Marcus soon discover the true meaning of love and find there is truth to the saying - that when you marry someone, you marry their entire family.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/hxtFC749PJxrwxuKzCuztBtBM8g=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/91/11189192_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/hxtFC749PJxrwxuKzCuztBtBM8g=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/91/11189192_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/hxtFC749PJxrwxuKzCuztBtBM8g=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/91/11189192_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/hxtFC749PJxrwxuKzCuztBtBM8g=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/91/11189192_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Forest Whitaker","id":"162662640","characters":["Bradford Boyd"]},{"name":"America Ferrera","id":"162652611","characters":["Lucia Ramirez"]},{"name":"Lance Gross","id":"770699858","characters":["Marcus Boyd"]},{"name":"Carlos Mencia","id":"364636601","characters":["Miguel Ramirez"]},{"name":"Regina King","id":"162661859","characters":["Angela"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Rick Famuyiwa"}],"studio":"Fox Searchlight","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1305583"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1305583","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/our_family_wedding/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770816443/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770816443/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770816443/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770816443.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
