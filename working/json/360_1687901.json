Haunted by the recent death of her fiance, she is approached by Robert Mallory (Dominic West) to investigate the recent death of a student at the all-boys boarding school where he teaches. When students at the school report sightings of the young boy's ghost, she decides to take on the case. Initially, the mystery surrounding the ghost appears nothing more than a schoolboy prank, but as Florence continues to investigate events at the school, she begins to believe that her reliance on science may not be enough to explain the strange phenomenon going on around her. -- (C) Cohen Media Group","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/9EbCTvyKpwDa32X_zgV-FrrhGTA=/54x78/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/58/11165805_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/9EbCTvyKpwDa32X_zgV-FrrhGTA=/54x78/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/58/11165805_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/9EbCTvyKpwDa32X_zgV-FrrhGTA=/54x78/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/58/11165805_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/9EbCTvyKpwDa32X_zgV-FrrhGTA=/54x78/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/58/11165805_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Rebecca Hall","id":"355028248","characters":["Florence Cathcart"]},{"name":"Dominic West","id":"162662802","characters":["Robert Mallory"]},{"name":"Imelda Staunton","id":"162693364","characters":["Maud Hill"]},{"name":"Isaac Hempstead-Wright","id":"771398908","characters":["Tom"]},{"name":"Shaun Dooley","id":"770729459","characters":["Malcolm McNair"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Nick Murphy"}],"studio":"Cohen Media Group","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1687901"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1687901","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_awakening_2011/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771249985/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771249985/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771249985/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771249985.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
