But just as his career is taking off, Crowley walks away from it all when his two youngest children, Megan and Patrick, are diagnosed with a fatal disease. Crowley teams up with scientist, Dr. Robert Stonehill. Together they form a bio-tech company focused on developing a life-saving drug. One driven to prove himself and his theories, the other by a chance to save his children, this unlikely alliance eventually develops into mutual respect as they battle the medical and business establishments in a fight against the system -- and time. But, when it appears that a solution has been found, the relationship between the two men faces a final test.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/5TQlE95eQxRrvN7fWIxtwMqvhoc=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/10/92/75/10927597_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/5TQlE95eQxRrvN7fWIxtwMqvhoc=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/10/92/75/10927597_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/5TQlE95eQxRrvN7fWIxtwMqvhoc=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/10/92/75/10927597_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/5TQlE95eQxRrvN7fWIxtwMqvhoc=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/10/92/75/10927597_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Harrison Ford","id":"162661579","characters":["Dr. Robert Stonehill"]},{"name":"Brendan Fraser","id":"162662763","characters":["John Crowley"]},{"name":"Keri Russell","id":"162685092","characters":["Aileen Crowley"]},{"name":"Meredith Droeger","id":"770921497","characters":["Megan Crowley"]},{"name":"Diego Velazquez","id":"770838923","characters":["Patrick Crowley"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Tom Vaughan"}],"studio":"CBS Films","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1244659"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1244659","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/extraordinary_measures/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770818424/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770818424/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770818424/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770818424.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
