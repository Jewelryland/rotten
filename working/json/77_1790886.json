Their man: naive Marty Huggins (Zach Galifianakis), director of the local Tourism Center. At first, Marty appears to be the unlikeliest possible choice but, with the help of his new benefactors' support, a cutthroat campaign manager and his family's political connections, he soon becomes a contender who gives the charismatic Cam plenty to worry about. As Election Day closes in, the two are locked in a dead heat, with insults quickly escalating to injury until all they care about is burying each other, in this mud-slinging, back-stabbing, home-wrecking comedy. -- (C) Warner Bros.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/PDGePn-pdZgXU605dWWAMPXwsII=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/72/11167275_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/PDGePn-pdZgXU605dWWAMPXwsII=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/72/11167275_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/PDGePn-pdZgXU605dWWAMPXwsII=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/72/11167275_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/PDGePn-pdZgXU605dWWAMPXwsII=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/72/11167275_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Will Ferrell","id":"162652185","characters":["Cam Brady"]},{"name":"Zach Galifianakis","id":"162655230","characters":["Marty Huggins"]},{"name":"Jason Sudeikis","id":"770702194","characters":["Mitch"]},{"name":"Dylan McDermott","id":"162674210","characters":["Tim Wattley"]},{"name":"Katherine LaNasa","id":"770694795","characters":["Rose Brady"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Jay Roach"}],"studio":"Warner Bros.
