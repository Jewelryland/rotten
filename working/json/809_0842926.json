The committed parents of two teenage children, Nic (Annette Bening) and Jules (Julianne Moore), are about to send their daughter, Joni (Mia Wasikowska), off to college when her younger brother, Laser (Josh Hutcherson), asks for her help in tracking down his biological father. Reluctantly inquiring with the sperm bank, Joni leaves her number so the office can pass it along to Laser's father. Enthusiastic at the thought of meeting his long lost offspring, Paul (Mark Ruffalo) musters the courage to reach out, and the family tree grows a new branch.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/00GBND3wjBMAEWTSo9I4CQIYRXc=/53x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/12/19/11121977_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/00GBND3wjBMAEWTSo9I4CQIYRXc=/53x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/12/19/11121977_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/00GBND3wjBMAEWTSo9I4CQIYRXc=/53x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/12/19/11121977_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/00GBND3wjBMAEWTSo9I4CQIYRXc=/53x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/12/19/11121977_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Julianne Moore","id":"162654248","characters":["Jules"]},{"name":"Annette Bening","id":"162660402","characters":["Nic"]},{"name":"Mark Ruffalo","id":"162653904","characters":["Paul"]},{"name":"Mia Wasikowska","id":"770688391","characters":["Joni"]},{"name":"Josh Hutcherson","id":"162654356","characters":["Laser"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Lisa Cholodenko"}],"studio":"Focus Features","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"0842926"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=0842926","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10012141-kids_are_all_right/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770819676/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770819676/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770819676/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770819676.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
