Joining a Norwegian scientific team that has stumbled across an extraterrestrial ship buried in the ice, she discovers an organism that seems to have died in the crash eons ago. But it is about to wake up. When a simple experiment frees the alien from its frozen prison, Kate must join the crew's pilot, Carter (Joel Edgerton), to keep it from killing them off one at a time. And in this vast, intense land, a parasite that can mimic anything it touches will pit human against human as it tries to survive and flourish. The Thing serves as a prelude to John Carpenter's classic 1982 film of the same name. -- (C) Universal","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/diesWyakwNtVDxH7OWJPn2brj3w=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/36/11163634_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/diesWyakwNtVDxH7OWJPn2brj3w=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/36/11163634_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/diesWyakwNtVDxH7OWJPn2brj3w=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/36/11163634_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/diesWyakwNtVDxH7OWJPn2brj3w=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/36/11163634_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Joel Edgerton","id":"162733204","characters":["Baxter Carter"]},{"name":"Mary Elizabeth Winstead","id":"341817661","characters":["Kate Lloyd"]},{"name":"Ulrich Thomsen","id":"326298137","characters":["Dr. Sander Halvorson"]},{"name":"Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje","id":"405589153","characters":["Jameson"]},{"name":"Eric Christian Olsen","id":"162673659","characters":["Adam Goldman"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Matthijs van Heijningen Jr."},{"name":"Matthijs van Heijningen"}],"studio":"Universal Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"0905372"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=0905372","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_thing_2011/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771202933/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771202933/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771202933/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771202933.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
