Andy Conners (Josh Meyers) may not be the most experienced lover on his block, but his love for Lauren (Krysten Ritter) is the one thing that keeps him sane in a crazy world. But Andy's lovemaking skills aren't the problem; it's his lack of communication skills that are slowly driving Lauren away. As Andy consults with his best friend Layne to learn the secrets of driving women wild, Lauren airs her grievances to her sympathetic girlfriends and falls under the charms of her handsome ex. Later, Lauren is offered a job in Chicago, and prepares to start a new life without Andy. By the time Andy realizes his mistake, Lauren is already on a flight to the Windy City. Perhaps now that he's learned the truth about his shortcomings as a communicator, Andy can find a way to convince the love of his life to give him a second chance. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/63/11166303_tmb.jpg","profile":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/63/11166303_tmb.jpg","detailed":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/63/11166303_tmb.jpg","original":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/16/63/11166303_tmb.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Josh Meyers","id":"770788151","characters":["Andy"]},{"name":"Krysten Ritter","id":"770688427","characters":["Lauren"]},{"name":"Ian Somerhalder","id":"162690694","characters":["Daniel"]},{"name":"Ken Jeong","id":"770692484","characters":["Curtis"]},{"name":"Lindsay Richards","id":"770851476","characters":["Nomi"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Scott Culver"}],"studio":"E1 Entertainment","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1241017"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1241017","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/how-to-make-love-to-a-woman/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770815781/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770815781/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770815781/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770815781.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
