Like nothing you've ever seen, Randy Moore's directorial debut is a bold and ingenious trip into the happiest place on earth. An epic battle begins when a middle-aged American husband and father of two learns that he has lost his job. Keeping the news from his nagging wife and wound-up children, he packs up the family and embarks on a full day of park hopping amid enchanted castles and fairytale princesses. Soon, the manufactured mirth of the fantasy land around him begins to haunt his subconscious. An idyllic family vacation quickly unravels into a surrealist nightmare of paranoid visions, bizarre encounters, and an obsessive pursuit of a pair of sexy teenage Parisians. Chillingly shot in black and white, ESCAPE FROM TOMORROW dissects the mythology of artificial perfection while subversively attacking our culture's obsession with mass entertainment.(c) FilmBuff","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/17/33/11173359_tmb.jpg","profile":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/17/33/11173359_tmb.jpg","detailed":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/17/33/11173359_tmb.jpg","original":"http://content9.flixster.com/movie/11/17/33/11173359_tmb.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Roy Abramsohn","id":"770743408","characters":["Jim"]},{"name":"Elena Schuber","id":"771432541","characters":["Emily"]},{"name":"Katelynn Rodriguez","id":"771432542","characters":["Sara"]},{"name":"Annet Mahendru","id":"770867829","characters":["Isabelle"]},{"name":"Danielle Safady","id":"771432544","characters":["Sophie"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Randy Moore"}],"studio":"FilmBuff","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"2187884"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=2187884","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/escape_from_tomorrow_2013/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771324995/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771324995/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771324995/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771324995.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
