In fact, he's so cool he's even dissing his best friend Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). But trouble arrives when an intriguing stranger Jerry (Colin Farrell) moves in next door. He seems like a great guy at first, but there's something not quite right-and everyone, including Charlie's mom (Toni Collette), doesn't notice. After witnessing some very unusual activity, Charlie comes to an unmistakable conclusion: Jerry is a vampire preying on his neighborhood. Unable to convince anyone that he's telling the truth, Charlie has to find a way to get rid of the monster himself in this revamp of the comedy-horror classic. -- (C) DreamWorks","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/uzpLRhiHKhU0NRVtSK5JzUKvMPs=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/75/11157537_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/uzpLRhiHKhU0NRVtSK5JzUKvMPs=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/75/11157537_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/uzpLRhiHKhU0NRVtSK5JzUKvMPs=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/75/11157537_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/uzpLRhiHKhU0NRVtSK5JzUKvMPs=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/75/11157537_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Anton Yelchin","id":"162673323","characters":["Charley Brewster"]},{"name":"Colin Farrell","id":"162665297","characters":["Jerry"]},{"name":"Toni Collette","id":"162654444","characters":["Jane Brewster"]},{"name":"Christopher Mintz-Plasse","id":"770679139","characters":["Ed"]},{"name":"David Tennant","id":"364606822","characters":["Peter Vincent"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Craig Gillespie"}],"studio":"Walt Disney Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1438176"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1438176","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fright_night-2011/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771028776/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771028776/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771028776/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771028776.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
