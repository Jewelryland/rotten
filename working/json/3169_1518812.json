Claiming to know a shortcut, Meek leads the group on an unmarked path across the high plain desert, only to become lost in the dry rock and sage. Over the coming days, the emigrants face the scourges of hunger, thirst and their own lack of faith in one another's instincts for survival. When a Native American wanderer crosses their path, the emigrants are torn between their trust in a guide who has proven himself unreliable and a man who has always been seen as a natural born enemy. -- (C) Oscilloscope","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/mpycxspH_evnzpCwU68A6f3Bk2s=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/57/11155788_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/mpycxspH_evnzpCwU68A6f3Bk2s=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/57/11155788_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/mpycxspH_evnzpCwU68A6f3Bk2s=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/57/11155788_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/mpycxspH_evnzpCwU68A6f3Bk2s=/54x79/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/57/11155788_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Michelle Williams","id":"162653583","characters":["Emily Tetherow"]},{"name":"Shirley Henderson","id":"162729895","characters":["Glory White"]},{"name":"Paul Dano","id":"303713360","characters":["Thomas Gately"]},{"name":"Bruce Greenwood","id":"162654291","characters":["Stephen Meek"]},{"name":"Will Patton","id":"162690561","characters":["Solomon Tetherow"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Kelly Reichardt"}],"studio":"Oscilloscope Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1518812"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1518812","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/meeks_cutoff/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771203826/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771203826/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771203826/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771203826.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
