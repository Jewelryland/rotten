Behind their pristine walls and manicured gardens, Kyle (Nicolas Cage), a fast-talking businessman, has entrusted the mansion's renovation to his stunning wife, Sarah (Nicole Kidman). But between making those big decisions and keeping tabs on their defiant teenage daughter (Liana Liberato), Sarah often finds herself distracted by a young, handsome worker (Cam Gigandet) at their home. Nothing is what it seems, and it will take a group of cold-blooded criminals led by Elias (Ben Mendelsohn), who have been planning a vicious home invasion for months, to bring the Miller family together. Kyle, Sarah and Avery will take the ultimate risk to make it out with their lives - and their family - intact. -- (C) Millenium","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/ddkXxZNENhO91l2M8wnCy7F8IfM=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/92/11159248_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/ddkXxZNENhO91l2M8wnCy7F8IfM=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/92/11159248_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/ddkXxZNENhO91l2M8wnCy7F8IfM=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/92/11159248_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/ddkXxZNENhO91l2M8wnCy7F8IfM=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/92/11159248_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Nicolas Cage","id":"162653923","characters":["Kyle Miller"]},{"name":"Nicole Kidman","id":"162652279","characters":["Sarah Miller"]},{"name":"Ben Mendelsohn","id":"284495637","characters":["Elias"]},{"name":"Liana Liberato","id":"539539287","characters":["Avery Miller"]},{"name":"Cam Gigandet","id":"770699333","characters":["Jonah"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Joel Schumacher"}],"studio":"Millennium Entertainment","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1674784"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1674784","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/trespass_2011/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771208334/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771208334/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771208334/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771208334.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
