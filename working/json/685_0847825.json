John Lazarus (Nick Stahl) can read minds. Ever since he was a child, the NSA told John that his telepathy was the result of a rare disease. But when John meets Kira (Taryn Manning), he realizes that his life has been one big lie. No one with John's ability has ever lived to the age of 29 with their sanity intact, and now his own time is fast running out. With nowhere to run and nothing to lose, John determines to get answers, or die trying. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/7EPBhXPk9lWShzbRq2KNPWDJtno=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/53/11165329_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/7EPBhXPk9lWShzbRq2KNPWDJtno=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/53/11165329_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/7EPBhXPk9lWShzbRq2KNPWDJtno=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/53/11165329_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/7EPBhXPk9lWShzbRq2KNPWDJtno=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/53/11165329_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Mia Maestro","id":"162653120","characters":["Anna"]},{"name":"Nick Stahl","id":"162686939","characters":["John Lazarus"]},{"name":"Taryn Manning","id":"162652996","characters":["Kira"]},{"name":"Blair Brown","id":"162668063"},{"name":"Erik Palladino","id":"561230177"}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Evan Oppenheimer"}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"0847825"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=0847825","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_speed_of_thought/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771229272/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771229272/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771229272/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771229272.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
