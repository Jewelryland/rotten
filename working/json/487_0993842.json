She is bright, inquisitive, and a devoted daughter. Uniquely, she has the strength, the stamina, and the smarts of a soldier; these come from being raised by her widowed father Erik (Eric Bana), an ex-CIA man, in the wilds of North Finland. Erik has taught Hanna to hunt, put her through extreme self-defense workouts, and home-schooled her with only an encyclopedia and a book of fairy tales. Hanna has been living a life unlike any other teenager; her upbringing and training have been one and the same, all geared to making her the perfect assassin. But out in the world there is unfinished business for Hanna's family, and it is with a combination of pride and apprehension that Erik realizes his daughter can no longer be held back. -- (C) Focus Features","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/JCGFSnI9n3xsAXazGQF9DKv8Stc=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/12/11171281_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/JCGFSnI9n3xsAXazGQF9DKv8Stc=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/12/11171281_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/JCGFSnI9n3xsAXazGQF9DKv8Stc=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/12/11171281_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/JCGFSnI9n3xsAXazGQF9DKv8Stc=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/12/11171281_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Saoirse Ronan","id":"770680691","characters":["Hanna"]},{"name":"Cate Blanchett","id":"162659162","characters":["Marissa"]},{"name":"Eric Bana","id":"162662190","characters":["Erik"]},{"name":"Jason Flemyng","id":"162662243","characters":["Sebastian"]},{"name":"Olivia Williams","id":"162662296","characters":["Rachel"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Joe Wright"}],"studio":"Focus Features","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"0993842"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=0993842","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hanna/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771091481/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771091481/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771091481/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771091481.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
