Money is tight, and navigating Hannah's healthcare and special needs education is a constant struggle. Despite that, Curtis and Samantha are very much in love and their family is a happy one. Then Curtis begins having terrifying dreams about an encroaching, apocalyptic storm. He chooses to keep the disturbance to himself, channeling his anxiety into the obsessive building of a storm shelter in their backyard. But the resulting strain on his marriage and tension within the community doesn't compare to Curtis' private fear of what his dreams may truly signify. Faced with the proposition that his disturbing visions signal disaster of one kind or another, Curtis confides in Samantha, testing the power of their bond against the highest possible stakes. -- (C) Sony Classics","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/553TXMw4yjE8RS7904ZvwDTV4Ts=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/89/11158902_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/553TXMw4yjE8RS7904ZvwDTV4Ts=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/89/11158902_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/553TXMw4yjE8RS7904ZvwDTV4Ts=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/89/11158902_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/553TXMw4yjE8RS7904ZvwDTV4Ts=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/89/11158902_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Michael Shannon","id":"368451324","characters":["Curtis"]},{"name":"Jessica Chastain","id":"770760183","characters":["Samantha"]},{"name":"Tova Stewart","id":"771094099","characters":["Hannah"]},{"name":"Shea Whigham","id":"341818156","characters":["Dewart"]},{"name":"Katy Mixon","id":"770692485","characters":["Nat"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Jeff Nichols (VI)"},{"name":"Jeffrey Nicholson"}],"studio":"Sony Pictures Classics","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1675192"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1675192","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/take_shelter/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771224184/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771224184/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771224184/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771224184.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
