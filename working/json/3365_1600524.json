HEARTBEATS was a hit at the Cannes Film Festival, winning the Youth Prize, and an official selection of the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival. Part farce, part exploration of the complexity of love and desire, HEARTBEATS centers on two close friends, Francis (Xavier Dolan) and Marie (Monia Chokri), who find themselves fighting for the affections of the same striking young man (Neils Schneider). The more intimate the trio becomes, the more unattainable the object of their infatuation seems, sending the friends' obsession into overdrive. -- (C) IFC Films","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/95kQ6UfP-twQw19Q2wrvHkAFGrY=/54x78/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/59/11155903_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/95kQ6UfP-twQw19Q2wrvHkAFGrY=/54x78/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/59/11155903_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/95kQ6UfP-twQw19Q2wrvHkAFGrY=/54x78/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/59/11155903_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/95kQ6UfP-twQw19Q2wrvHkAFGrY=/54x78/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/59/11155903_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Monia Chokri","id":"770911285","characters":["Marie"]},{"name":"Niels Schneider","id":"770699318","characters":["Nicolas"]},{"name":"Xavier Dolan","id":"770842265","characters":["Francis"]},{"name":"Anne Dorval","id":"326396311"},{"name":"Anne Elisabeth Bosse","id":"771450857"}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Xavier Dolan"}],"studio":"IFC Films","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1600524"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1600524","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/les_amours_imaginaires/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771040507/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771040507/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771040507/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771040507.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
