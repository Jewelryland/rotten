After unexpectedly losing his beloved dog Sparky, young Victor harnesses the power of science to bring his best friend back to life-with just a few minor adjustments. He tries to hide his home-sewn creation, but when Sparky gets out, Victor's fellow students, teachers and the entire town all learn that getting a new \"leash on life\" can be monstrous. A stop-motion animated film, Frankenweenie will be filmed in black and white and rendered in 3D, which will elevate the classic style to a whole new experience. -- (C) Disney","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/I469R4P0Z5N7t6UmwLqlXNEdVuw=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/54/11165465_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/I469R4P0Z5N7t6UmwLqlXNEdVuw=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/54/11165465_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/I469R4P0Z5N7t6UmwLqlXNEdVuw=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/54/11165465_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/I469R4P0Z5N7t6UmwLqlXNEdVuw=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/54/11165465_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Charlie Tahan","id":"770670076","characters":["Victor Frankenstein"]},{"name":"Winona Ryder","id":"162659115","characters":["Elsa Van Helsing"]},{"name":"Martin Landau","id":"162658209","characters":["Mr. Rzykruski"]},{"name":"Catherine O'Hara","id":"162658234","characters":["Mrs. Frankenstein/Gym Teacher/Weird Girl"]},{"name":"Martin Short","id":"162657763","characters":["Mr. Frankenstein/Mr. Burgemeister/Nassor"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Tim Burton"}],"studio":"Walt Disney Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1142977"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1142977","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/frankenweenie_2012/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771205894/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771205894/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771205894/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771205894.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
