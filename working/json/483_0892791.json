There used to be a time when the villagers would run in terror at the mere mention of the name Shrek, but these days the big green ogre is married to Princess Fiona and raising triplets. Maintaining your fierce public persona is no simple task when you're juggling infants and changing diapers, so when Shrek realizes that nobody is afraid of him anymore he recruits mischief-maker Rumpelstiltskin to restore his once-mighty roar. Unfortunately for Shrek, that plan hits an unexpected hitch. As a result, the morose monster takes a trip into an alternate-universe Far Far Away land where there is no Shrek, and Rumpelstiltskin reigns. There, Donkey spends his days hauling carts, and a portly Puss in Boots prefers lounging to swashbuckling. Perhaps with a little extra effort, Shrek will be able to regain his status as top ogre in town and still have his happily ever after, too. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/wXXEl3rt_eCHfftBCU_BJnmgToY=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/12/76/11127605_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/wXXEl3rt_eCHfftBCU_BJnmgToY=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/12/76/11127605_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/wXXEl3rt_eCHfftBCU_BJnmgToY=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/12/76/11127605_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/wXXEl3rt_eCHfftBCU_BJnmgToY=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/12/76/11127605_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Mike Myers","id":"162659399","characters":["Shrek"]},{"name":"Eddie Murphy","id":"162657430","characters":["Donkey"]},{"name":"Cameron Diaz","id":"162654443","characters":["Princess Fiona"]},{"name":"Antonio Banderas","id":"162654885","characters":["Puss in Boots"]},{"name":"Julie Andrews","id":"162655749","characters":["Queen"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Andrew Adamson"},{"name":"Mike Mitchell"}],"studio":"Paramount","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"0892791"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=0892791","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shrek_forever_after/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770810590/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770810590/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770810590/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770810590.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
