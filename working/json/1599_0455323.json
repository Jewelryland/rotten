Based on a true story, Being Flynn follows Nick Flynn (Paul Dano) who is shocked to have his eccentric and long-absent father, Jonathan (Robert De Niro) reach out to him unexpectedly. Still feeling the loss of his mother (played in flashbacks by Julianne Moore) in the midst of starting a new relationship with Denise (Olivia Thirlby), the last person Nick wants to see is his father. But you can't outrun fate and slowly Nick comes to realize he has been given the chance to make a real future not only for himself, but for his struggling father too. -- (C) Focus","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/i_Z69AnnFGil4jDSOKsn3fYTR-c=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/23/11162389_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/i_Z69AnnFGil4jDSOKsn3fYTR-c=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/23/11162389_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/i_Z69AnnFGil4jDSOKsn3fYTR-c=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/23/11162389_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/i_Z69AnnFGil4jDSOKsn3fYTR-c=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/23/11162389_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Robert De Niro","id":"162655521","characters":["Jonathan Flynn"]},{"name":"Paul Dano","id":"303713360","characters":["Nick Flynn"]},{"name":"Julianne Moore","id":"162654248","characters":["Jody Flynn"]},{"name":"Olivia Thirlby","id":"326433362","characters":["Denise"]},{"name":"Eddie Rouse","id":"528360974","characters":["Carlos"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Paul Weitz"}],"studio":"Focus Features","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"0455323"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=0455323","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/being_flynn/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771234601/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771234601/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771234601/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771234601.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
