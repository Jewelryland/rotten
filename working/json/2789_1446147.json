Julian only thought about women. With neither really working out, the childhood best friends decide to start a detective agency. Unfortunately for them, on their first case they must help protect a sexy, high class escort who holds the key evidence to a scandalous cover up. The two bumbling detectives soon find themselves running from the mob, a corrupt US Senator, and a ruthless Mary Poppins-like assassin - all of whom would stop at nothing to hide the truth. It's just an average day for two bumbling losers. -- (c) Lleju","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/1zV11Z27fl4iG_D91wBNXoxMNEQ=/40x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/58/11155855_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/1zV11Z27fl4iG_D91wBNXoxMNEQ=/40x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/58/11155855_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/1zV11Z27fl4iG_D91wBNXoxMNEQ=/40x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/58/11155855_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/1zV11Z27fl4iG_D91wBNXoxMNEQ=/40x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/58/11155855_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Paz Vega","id":"162660742","characters":["Catalina Rona"]},{"name":"Janet McTeer","id":"162662355","characters":["Helen Bingham"]},{"name":"Alphonso McAuley","id":"770733290","characters":["Julian Simms"]},{"name":"Scott Mechlowicz","id":"162690724","characters":["Anthony Hester"]},{"name":"Christopher McDonald","id":"162680629","characters":["Bill Krebb"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"John Stockwell"}],"studio":"Paladin","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1446147"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1446147","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cat_run/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771229606/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771229606/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771229606/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771229606.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
