Joining the police force and the secret Jump Street unit, they use their youthful appearances to go undercover in a local high school. As they trade in their guns and badges for backpacks, Schmidt and Jenko risk their lives to investigate a violent and dangerous drug ring. But they find that high school is nothing like they left it just a few years earlier - and neither expects that they will have to confront the terror and anxiety of being a teenager again and all the issues they thought they had left behind. -- (C) Sony Pictures","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/yzuRpiAyzXOWrqIji_z8Ru4lWgI=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/56/11165666_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/yzuRpiAyzXOWrqIji_z8Ru4lWgI=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/56/11165666_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/yzuRpiAyzXOWrqIji_z8Ru4lWgI=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/56/11165666_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/yzuRpiAyzXOWrqIji_z8Ru4lWgI=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/56/11165666_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Jonah Hill","id":"326297850","characters":["Schmidt"]},{"name":"Channing Tatum","id":"162661835","characters":["Jenko"]},{"name":"Brie Larson","id":"341816562","characters":["Molly Tracey"]},{"name":"Dave Franco","id":"770703179","characters":["Eric Molson"]},{"name":"Rob Riggle","id":"770750133","characters":["Mr. Walters"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Chris Miller"},{"name":"Phil Lord"}],"studio":"Sony Pictures","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1232829"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1232829","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/21-jump-street-2011/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770863876/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770863876/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770863876/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770863876.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
