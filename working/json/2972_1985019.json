For as long as she can remember, Jane Hayes (Keri Russell) has treasured the writings of the author behind such literary classics as Emma, and Pride & Prejudice. For years, Jane had been stashing away funds in hopes that someday she would be able to afford a trip to Austenland - a place where the die-hard fan can be completely immersed in the elegant world of the beloved author. When Jane finally manages to save up enough, she excitedly packs her bags and books a room. Upon arriving, Jane quickly discovers that Austenland is everything she had ever imagined. Every detail is exquisite, save for one small exception: Jane's limited funds mean that she can't enjoy the same luxury experience as the other, wealthier bachelorettes who currently populate Austenland, but she decides to make the most of her trip regardless. Later, when Jane falls into a romance with a dashing young servant, a lifetime of dreams suddenly begin to come true. Jane Seymour, James Callis, and Jennifer Coolidge co-star. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/0Wt4-AxHjOFK3qzu5eE2biP217w=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/26/11172696_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/0Wt4-AxHjOFK3qzu5eE2biP217w=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/26/11172696_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/0Wt4-AxHjOFK3qzu5eE2biP217w=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/26/11172696_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/0Wt4-AxHjOFK3qzu5eE2biP217w=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/26/11172696_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Keri Russell","id":"162685092","characters":["Jane Hayes"]},{"name":"J.J.
