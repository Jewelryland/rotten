Marley Corbett (Kate Hudson) is young, beautiful, and wildly funny, but she's afraid of opening herself up to true love and commitment. Though she uses her humor to prevent matters from getting serious, a life-changing visit to her doctor (Gael Garcia Bernal) sends both of them on an eye-opening adventure of mutual discovery, leading to revelations neither thought possible. -- (C) Official Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/-QBOhKwnIeyGzKnFapWlJlURD_w=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/40/11164093_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/-QBOhKwnIeyGzKnFapWlJlURD_w=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/40/11164093_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/-QBOhKwnIeyGzKnFapWlJlURD_w=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/40/11164093_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/-QBOhKwnIeyGzKnFapWlJlURD_w=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/40/11164093_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Kate Hudson","id":"162653218","characters":["Marley Corbett"]},{"name":"Lucy Punch","id":"510743072","characters":["Sarah Walker"]},{"name":"Kathy Bates","id":"162660148","characters":["Beverly Corbett"]},{"name":"Peter Dinklage","id":"162653586","characters":["Vinnie"]},{"name":"Gael Garcia Bernal","id":"162684026","characters":["Julian Goldstein"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Nicole Kassell"}],"studio":"Millenium Entertainment","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1440161"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1440161","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_little_bit_of_heaven_2011/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771224742/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771224742/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771224742/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771224742.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
