But Red is forced to cut her training short when she gets an urgent call from Nicky Flippers (David Ogden Stiers), who returns as head of the super-secret Happily Ever After Agency, aka the HEA. A wicked witch (Joan Cusack) has abducted two innocent children, Hansel (Bill Hader) and Gretel (Amy Poehler), and Nicky needs Red for the search-and-rescue mission. Granny (Glenn Close) and the rest of the Hoodinked gang-including the ever-clueless Wolf (Patrick Warburton) and his over-caffeinated little partner, Twitchy (Cory Edwards), join Red to solve the forest's latest caper. -- (C) Official Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/C1LpxcTmSQT_JgxJdiZ8rc79Nv8=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/68/11156811_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/C1LpxcTmSQT_JgxJdiZ8rc79Nv8=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/68/11156811_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/C1LpxcTmSQT_JgxJdiZ8rc79Nv8=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/68/11156811_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/C1LpxcTmSQT_JgxJdiZ8rc79Nv8=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/68/11156811_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Hayden Panettiere","id":"162671852","characters":["Red"]},{"name":"Patrick Warburton","id":"326392258","characters":["Wolf"]},{"name":"David Ogden Stiers","id":"162658822","characters":["Nicky Flippers"]},{"name":"Glenn Close","id":"162653084","characters":["Granny"]},{"name":"Bill Hader","id":"742790769","characters":["Hansel"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Mike Disa"},{"name":"Michael D'Isa-Hogan"}],"studio":"The Weinstein Co.","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"0844993"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=0844993","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hoodwinked_too_hood_vs_evil/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770687008/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770687008/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770687008/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770687008.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
