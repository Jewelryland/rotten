Spurring Sally's investigation are the voices-rasping whispers who call out to her from the basement, who promise her understanding and friendship, who are so very hungry and would like to be set free. When Sally gives in to her curiosity, she opens a gateway into a hellish underworld from which an army of beady-eyed, sharp-clawed monsters emerge, small in size but endless in number. Confronted with the horror that now threatens to taker her life and destroy her family, Sally desperately tries to warn the whole house, but there's just one problem: no one believes her. -- (C) Miramax","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/GODLYDxxyfI3Pd5eji-20LDeN7w=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/36/11163652_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/GODLYDxxyfI3Pd5eji-20LDeN7w=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/36/11163652_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/GODLYDxxyfI3Pd5eji-20LDeN7w=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/36/11163652_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/GODLYDxxyfI3Pd5eji-20LDeN7w=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/36/11163652_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Bailee Madison","id":"387371602","characters":["Sally"]},{"name":"Katie Holmes","id":"162652648","characters":["Kim"]},{"name":"Guy Pearce","id":"162660324","characters":["Alex"]},{"name":"Jack Thompson","id":"162682161","characters":["Harris"]},{"name":"Alan Dale","id":"770695617","characters":["Charles Jacoby"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Troy Nixey"}],"studio":"Miramax Films","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1270761"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1270761","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dont_be_afraid_of_the_dark_2011/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770875156/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770875156/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770875156/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770875156.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
