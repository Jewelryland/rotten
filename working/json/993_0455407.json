But one night, one of them comes to a school baseball game with a loaded shotgun, ready to kill. Another man burns down his own house, after locking his wife and young son in a closet inside. Something is infecting the citizens of Ogden Marsh -- with insanity. In an effort to keep the madness contained, the government uses deadly force to close off all access and won't let anyone in or out -- even those uninfected. The few still sane find themselves trapped: Forced to band together, an ordinary night becomes a horrifying struggle for survival as they do their best to get out of town alive.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/qcFnm9a56CWIK887YfXd4mfzV_g=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/10/93/48/10934852_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/qcFnm9a56CWIK887YfXd4mfzV_g=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/10/93/48/10934852_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/qcFnm9a56CWIK887YfXd4mfzV_g=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/10/93/48/10934852_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/qcFnm9a56CWIK887YfXd4mfzV_g=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/10/93/48/10934852_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Timothy Olyphant","id":"162696544","characters":["David Dutten"]},{"name":"Radha Mitchell","id":"162688762","characters":["Judy Dutten"]},{"name":"Joe Anderson","id":"335717925","characters":["Russell"]},{"name":"Danielle Panabaker","id":"162652948","characters":["Becca"]},{"name":"Christie Lynn Smith","id":"770676363","characters":["Deardra Farnum"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Breck Eisner"}],"studio":"Overture Films","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"0455407"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=0455407","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1205380-crazies/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770805222/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770805222/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770805222/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770805222.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
