Megamind was only an infant when his parents loaded him into an emergency escape pod and jettisoned him into space just as their planet was being sucked into a black hole. His destination: planet Earth. Meanwhile, another slightly more wholesome baby sets out on the same trajectory. But while the latter will ultimately land in the home of a wealthy couple and grow up to become Metro Man, hero of Metro City, poor Megamind finds his fate taking the opposite course when his pod crashes in a prison yard, leaving him to be raised by convicts. Later, in grade school, the kids all flock to Metro Man, leaving a frustrated Megamind to embrace a life of diabolical misdeeds. As the years go by, Metro Man and Megamind develop an intense adversarial relationship that pits them in battle over Metro City time and again. Undeterred by his unbroken losing streak, Megamind hatches an ingenious scheme to finally destroy Metro Man by kidnapping pretty reporter Roxanne Ritchi (voice of Tina Fey), and luring the predictable hero into a deadly trap. Then something unexpected happens -- Megamind's plan actually works. Now, with Metro Man out of the picture, Megamind and his Minion (voice of David Cross) stake their claim on Metro City. But what good is ultimate power when you don't even have to fight for it? Realizing that life is simply out of balance without Metro Man to be the hero, Megamind creates a new foe who will be just as righteous and powerful as his fallen adversary. Unfortunately, Megamind's schemes usually have a way of backfiring, and when Metro City's newest savior proves even more evil than Megamind, the blue-hued antihero prepares to fight back with everything he's got. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/K02fGU-p3P3-QjKGbdaZmXEVZdE=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/78/11177842_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/K02fGU-p3P3-QjKGbdaZmXEVZdE=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/78/11177842_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/K02fGU-p3P3-QjKGbdaZmXEVZdE=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/78/11177842_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/K02fGU-p3P3-QjKGbdaZmXEVZdE=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/78/11177842_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Will Ferrell","id":"162652185","characters":["MegaMind"]},{"name":"Brad Pitt","id":"162652627","characters":["Metro Man"]},{"name":"Tina Fey","id":"427823878","characters":["Roxanne Ritchi"]},{"name":"Jonah Hill","id":"326297850","characters":["Tighten"]},{"name":"David Cross","id":"326299938","characters":["Minion"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Cameron Hood"},{"name":"Kyle Jefferson"}],"studio":"Paramount Studios/DWA","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1001526"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1001526","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/megamind/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770805424/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770805424/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770805424/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770805424.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
