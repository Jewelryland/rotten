Then, on one sunny day, their perfect world is irrevocably shattered . Leaving their five year old son, Ben, alone for only a moment, Craig is horrified to see him being abducted from their own front yard. Sadly, the desperate police search for the kidnapper proves to be in vain when the child is found dead. Months later, a chance tip leads police to the suspect's door, catching him red-handed with another victim. Although Ben's murderer is soon brought to trial, the grieving parents are stunned when his sentence is considerably reduced by a plea bargain. Together they decide to seek their own retribution, hatching a plot to kidnap the man and subject him to the same monstrous acts he perpetrated against their helpless son. -- (C) IFC","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/NIThGzuSCIutu1H_OxrF3Wt_t5Q=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/55/11165548_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/NIThGzuSCIutu1H_OxrF3Wt_t5Q=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/55/11165548_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/NIThGzuSCIutu1H_OxrF3Wt_t5Q=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/55/11165548_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/NIThGzuSCIutu1H_OxrF3Wt_t5Q=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/55/11165548_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Erika Christensen","id":"162654082","characters":["Elise Landry"]},{"name":"Jesse Metcalfe","id":"326392958","characters":["Craig Landry"]},{"name":"Bill Moseley","id":"368451839","characters":["John Kozlowski"]},{"name":"Fulvio Cecere","id":"770690401","characters":["Det.
