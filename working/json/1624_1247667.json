Henry has two options: fail and lose his college scholarship, or team up with his stoner friend Breaux (Sean Marquette) to beat the system. They steal a high powered ganja from law student-turned-drug-dealer Psycho Ed (Adrien Brody) and spike the school's bake sale brownies, getting the whole school-faculty included-completely stoned out of their minds. But with the student body getting higher and higher with every brownie, and a pissed-off Psycho Ed on their tails for stealing his stash, they must find a way to keep their half-baked plan from going up in smoke. -- (C) Official Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/-2Kf9bE10UShFdKXOgBesWLGN4g=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/46/11164603_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/-2Kf9bE10UShFdKXOgBesWLGN4g=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/46/11164603_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/-2Kf9bE10UShFdKXOgBesWLGN4g=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/46/11164603_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/-2Kf9bE10UShFdKXOgBesWLGN4g=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/46/11164603_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Adrien Brody","id":"162660902","characters":["Psycho Ed"]},{"name":"Matt Bush","id":"770781487","characters":["Henry Burke"]},{"name":"Sean Marquette","id":"420306916","characters":["Travis Breaux"]},{"name":"Michael Chiklis","id":"162652783","characters":["Dr. Leslie Gordon"]},{"name":"Colin Hanks","id":"162666499","characters":["Brandon Ellis"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"John Stalberg"},{"name":"John Stalberg, Jr."}],"studio":"Anchor Bay Entertainment","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1247667"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1247667","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10012150-high_school/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770808841/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770808841/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770808841/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770808841.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
