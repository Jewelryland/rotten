Though a loner by nature, Driver can't help falling in love with his beautiful neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan), a vulnerable young mother dragged into a dangerous underworld by the return of her ex-convict husband Standard (Oscar Isaac). After a heist intended to pay off Standard's protection money spins unpredictably out of control, Driver finds himself driving defense for the girl he loves, tailgated by a syndicate of deadly serious criminals. But when he realizes that the gangsters are after more than the bag of cash in his trunk-that they're coming straight for Irene and her son-Driver is forced to shift gears and go on offense. -- (C) FilmDistrict","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/68fmofPZxE7ocd9hkws0ZV3gtqU=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/36/11163653_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/68fmofPZxE7ocd9hkws0ZV3gtqU=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/36/11163653_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/68fmofPZxE7ocd9hkws0ZV3gtqU=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/36/11163653_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/68fmofPZxE7ocd9hkws0ZV3gtqU=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/36/11163653_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Ryan Gosling","id":"162654751","characters":["Driver"]},{"name":"Carey Mulligan","id":"770678627","characters":["Irene"]},{"name":"Albert Brooks","id":"162655677","characters":["Bernie Rose"]},{"name":"Bryan Cranston","id":"326392501","characters":["Shannon"]},{"name":"Christina Hendricks","id":"770682642","characters":["Blanche"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Nicolas Winding Refn"}],"studio":"FilmDistrict","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"0780504"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=0780504","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/drive_2011/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771224338/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771224338/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771224338/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771224338.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
