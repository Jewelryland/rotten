Blu is a domesticated Macaw who never learned to fly, living a comfortable life with his owner and best friend Linda in the small town of Moose Lake, Minnesota. Blu and Linda think he's the last of his kind, but when they learn about another Macaw who lives in Rio de Janeiro, they head to the faraway and exotic land to find Jewel, Blu's female counterpart. Not long after they arrive, Blu and Jewel are kidnapped by a group of bungling animal smugglers. With the help of street smart Jewel, and a group of wise-cracking and smooth-talking city birds, Blu escapes. Now, with his new friends by his side, Blu will have to find the courage to learn to fly, thwart the kidnappers who are hot on their trail, and return to Linda, the best friend a bird ever had. -- (C) Fox","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/rvLu3WiQMyo59Awnlmag6l2mg1s=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/65/11176523_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/rvLu3WiQMyo59Awnlmag6l2mg1s=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/65/11176523_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/rvLu3WiQMyo59Awnlmag6l2mg1s=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/65/11176523_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/rvLu3WiQMyo59Awnlmag6l2mg1s=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/65/11176523_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Anne Hathaway","id":"162656190","characters":["Jewel"]},{"name":"Jesse Eisenberg","id":"162654393","characters":["Blu"]},{"name":"Jamie Foxx","id":"162652975","characters":["Nico"]},{"name":"George Lopez","id":"162652717","characters":["Rafael"]},{"name":"Tracy Morgan","id":"326393834","characters":["Luiz"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Carlos Saldanha"}],"studio":"20th Century Fox","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1436562"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1436562","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/rio/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770858015/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770858015/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770858015/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770858015.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
