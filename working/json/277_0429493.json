Col. John \"Hannibal\" Smith (Liam Neeson), Templeton \"Face\" Peck (Bradley Cooper), B.A. Baracus (Quinton \"Rampage\" Jackson), and H.M. \"Howlin' Mad\" Murdock (Sharlto Copley) are a group of former Special Forces operatives who have been fighting the good fight for eight years when they're sentenced to military prison for a crime they didn't commit. Breaking out with relative ease, they embark on a treacherous quest to clear their names while being hunted across the globe by Charissa Sosa (Jessica Biel), a high-ranking military officer and one of Face's many former lovers. Meanwhile, mysterious CIA operative Lynch (Patrick Wilson) offers tips that help point the federal fugitives in the right direction, which seems to lead straight to former military contractor Pike (Brian Bloom), who may have been responsible for setting them up in the first place. Just when it seems that the A-Team has all the evidence needed to prove their innocence, however, they discover that their latest mission is just getting started. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/c1pu_tQVLFT22Zhij_IRifcPl_Y=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/80/11178052_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/c1pu_tQVLFT22Zhij_IRifcPl_Y=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/80/11178052_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/c1pu_tQVLFT22Zhij_IRifcPl_Y=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/80/11178052_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/c1pu_tQVLFT22Zhij_IRifcPl_Y=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/80/11178052_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Liam Neeson","id":"162652242","characters":["Hannibal Smith"]},{"name":"Bradley Cooper","id":"351525448","characters":["Templeton 'Faceman' Peck"]},{"name":"Sharlto Copley","id":"770674319","characters":["H.M.
