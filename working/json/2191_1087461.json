Goi's harrowing cautionary drama tells the story of two typical teenage girls who vanished without a trace after being accosted by an internet predator. 14 year old Megan Stewart and 13 year old Amy Herman were best friends. Like most typical adolescents, they enjoyed chatting on the internet, and partying with their friends. Then on January 14, 2007, the unthinkable happened. Megan simply disappeared into thin air. Her friends and family searched frantically, but to no avail. Three weeks later, Amy, too, went missing. To this day, neither of the girls has ever been found. The feature offers a disturbing glimpse into the events as they may have unfolded in the days leading up to Megan and Amy's disappearances.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Ch7vbzOEDfGEbaJ6bkPKvyYgUGQ=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/70/11187000_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Ch7vbzOEDfGEbaJ6bkPKvyYgUGQ=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/70/11187000_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Ch7vbzOEDfGEbaJ6bkPKvyYgUGQ=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/70/11187000_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Ch7vbzOEDfGEbaJ6bkPKvyYgUGQ=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/18/70/11187000_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Amber Perkins","id":"771096101","characters":["Amy"]},{"name":"Rachel Quinn","id":"771096102","characters":["Megan"]},{"name":"Dean Waite","id":"771096103","characters":["Josh/Re-Enactment Josh"]},{"name":"Jael Elizabeth Steinmeyer","id":"771102969","characters":["Lexie"]},{"name":"Rudy Galvan","id":"771102970","characters":["Ben"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Michael Goi"},{"name":"Michael K.
