At 50, he still dresses 'Goth' and lives in Dublin off his royalties. The death of his father, with whom he wasn't on speaking terms, brings him back to New York. He discovers his father had an obsession: to seek revenge for a humiliation he had suffered. Cheyenne decides to pick up where his father left off, and starts a journey, at his own pace, across America. -- (C) Weinstein","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/fLJvhBcvsRgNx2OqKshJihGUzQY=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/71/11167183_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/fLJvhBcvsRgNx2OqKshJihGUzQY=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/71/11167183_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/fLJvhBcvsRgNx2OqKshJihGUzQY=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/71/11167183_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/fLJvhBcvsRgNx2OqKshJihGUzQY=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/71/11167183_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Sean Penn","id":"162652280","characters":["Cheyenne"]},{"name":"Eve Hewson","id":"770817661","characters":["Mary"]},{"name":"Frances McDormand","id":"162654734","characters":["Jane"]},{"name":"Judd Hirsch","id":"364600906","characters":["Mordecai Midler"]},{"name":"Kerry Condon","id":"162652226","characters":["Rachel"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Paolo Sorrentino"}],"studio":"The Weinstein Company","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1440345"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1440345","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/this_must_be_the_place/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771240597/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771240597/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771240597/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771240597.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
