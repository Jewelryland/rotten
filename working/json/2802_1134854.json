Sarge Crocket (Alan Van Sprang) and his motley crew of military abandoners are searching for a safe place to rest when they cross paths with Patrick O'Flynn (Kenneth Welsh). O'Flynn has been banished from Plum Island, where his family is locked in a longtime quarrel with the Muldoons. The O'Flynns see the flesh-eaters as subhuman, never hesitating to put a bullet between their eyes; the Muldoons balk at the prospect of killing their gut-munching loved ones, instead opting to care for their rotting kinfolk until scientists find a cure for the undead scourge. As the division between the two families grows deeper and wider, Crocket and his men realize that on Plum Island, the zombies are the least of their worries.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/EpeYfTPtYoadueztQ1mSr4ur0Mg=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/14/76/11147659_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/EpeYfTPtYoadueztQ1mSr4ur0Mg=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/14/76/11147659_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/EpeYfTPtYoadueztQ1mSr4ur0Mg=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/14/76/11147659_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/EpeYfTPtYoadueztQ1mSr4ur0Mg=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/14/76/11147659_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Alan Van Sprang","id":"770721840","characters":["Crocket"]},{"name":"Kenneth Welsh","id":"364643706","characters":["Patrick O'Flynn"]},{"name":"Kathleen Munroe","id":"770672856","characters":["Janet/Jane"]},{"name":"Devon Bostick","id":"770688857","characters":["Boy"]},{"name":"Richard Fitzpatrick","id":"770694347","characters":["Seamus Muldoon"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"George A.
