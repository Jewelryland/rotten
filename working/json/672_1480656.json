As he is chauffeured across midtown Manhattan to get a haircut at his father's old barber, his anxious eyes are glued to the yuan's exchange rate: it is mounting against all expectations, destroying Eric's bet against it. Eric Packer is losing his empire with every tick of the clock. Meanwhile, an eruption of wild activity unfolds in the city's streets. Petrified as the threats of the real world infringe upon his cloud of virtual convictions, his paranoia intensifies during the course of his 24-hour cross-town odyssey. Packer starts to piece together clues that lead him to a most terrifying secret: his imminent assassination. -- (C) Official Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/QBLrKRbHucqDPC4s7_Uezwvfx-M=/54x73/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/41/11164165_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/QBLrKRbHucqDPC4s7_Uezwvfx-M=/54x73/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/41/11164165_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/QBLrKRbHucqDPC4s7_Uezwvfx-M=/54x73/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/41/11164165_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/QBLrKRbHucqDPC4s7_Uezwvfx-M=/54x73/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/41/11164165_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Robert Pattinson","id":"770677984","characters":["Eric Packer"]},{"name":"Jay Baruchel","id":"259260120","characters":["Shiner"]},{"name":"Samantha Morton","id":"162655611","characters":["Vija Kinski"]},{"name":"Kevin Durand","id":"684288210","characters":["Torval"]},{"name":"Paul Giamatti","id":"162683649","characters":["Benno Levin"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"David Cronenberg"}],"studio":"Entertainment One","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1480656"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1480656","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cosmopolis/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771225278/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771225278/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771225278/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771225278.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
