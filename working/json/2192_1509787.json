Ben and Alan have built a successful though larcenous business, posing as car valets, only to steal the vehicles instead of parking them. Because of their less-than-ideal childhoods and a \"job\" that allows them to remain likeable boyish rogues well into their 20's, their penchant for crime is almost forgivable. However, everything changes when they meet a twelve-year-old boy named Kelsey. Neglected by his mother, Kelsey is drawn to Ben and Alan and they to him--eventually, Kelsey becomes part mascot, part protege. His presence ultimately forces Alan and Ben to choose between a life of crime and fun (an extended childhood) and the opportunity to grow up and deal with the emotional consequences that come with it. -- (C) Official Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/LfmvosafNAHSaw6snEDH8IFgQAI=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/46/11164601_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/LfmvosafNAHSaw6snEDH8IFgQAI=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/46/11164601_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/LfmvosafNAHSaw6snEDH8IFgQAI=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/46/11164601_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/LfmvosafNAHSaw6snEDH8IFgQAI=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/46/11164601_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Jason Ritter","id":"430214023","characters":["Ben"]},{"name":"Jake Sandvig","id":"770737879","characters":["Alan"]},{"name":"Chandler Canterbury","id":"770683292","characters":["Kelsey"]},{"name":"Rebecca Hall","id":"355028248","characters":["Melanie"]},{"name":"Todd Louiso","id":"162709418","characters":["Marty"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Brian Crano"}],"studio":"MPI Media Group","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1509787"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1509787","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_bag_of_hammers/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771237202/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771237202/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771237202/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771237202.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
