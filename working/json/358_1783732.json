On the street they call it Soy Sauce, and users drift across time and dimensions. But some who come back are no longer human. Suddenly a silent otherworldly invasion is underway, and mankind needs a hero. What it gets instead is John and David, a pair of college dropouts who can barely hold down jobs. Can these two stop the oncoming horror in time to save humanity? No. No, they can't. -- (C) Official Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/sheqtdW1QBhNk3onH0vo5u8fVRw=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/71/11167149_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/sheqtdW1QBhNk3onH0vo5u8fVRw=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/71/11167149_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/sheqtdW1QBhNk3onH0vo5u8fVRw=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/71/11167149_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/sheqtdW1QBhNk3onH0vo5u8fVRw=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/71/11167149_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Chase Williamson","id":"771383437","characters":["Dave"]},{"name":"Rob Mayes","id":"770701513","characters":["John"]},{"name":"Paul Giamatti","id":"162683649","characters":["Arnie Blondestone"]},{"name":"Clancy Brown","id":"162663805","characters":["Dr. Albert Marconi"]},{"name":"Glynn E.
