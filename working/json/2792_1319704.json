Eva (Imogen Poots) is a young model whose good looks and poise disguise her aching doubts about herself and her wishes she could be more like others. Jim (Matthew Beard) is still wrestling with the demons brought on by a painful childhood and tries to beat back his fears with drugs. Emily (Hannah Murray) feels plain and unattractive and is filled with resentment towards her ambitious father and mother. And Mo (Daniel Kaluuya) struggles with his sexual desires for children, in particular the sister of a close friend. These four young people are frequent visitors to an internet chat room, where they can talk about their fears and anxieties while being drawn out by the compassionate moderator. But the man who runs the chat room is not all he seems. William (Aaron Johnson) is the unstable and neglected son of a successful author (Megan Dodds); he's grown to hate his more confident brother Ripley (Richard Madden) and has established the chat room in order to manipulate others to his own ends by getting them to share their secrets and using this knowledge against them. Chatroom was the second English-language feature from Japanese horror veteran Hideo Nakata. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/yAENmfhrEamtPpwHkMeLhjeuIUc=/54x72/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/10/11171016_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/yAENmfhrEamtPpwHkMeLhjeuIUc=/54x72/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/10/11171016_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/yAENmfhrEamtPpwHkMeLhjeuIUc=/54x72/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/10/11171016_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/yAENmfhrEamtPpwHkMeLhjeuIUc=/54x72/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/10/11171016_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Aaron Taylor-Johnson","id":"326397411","characters":["William"]},{"name":"Imogen Poots","id":"770678493","characters":["Eva"]},{"name":"Matthew Beard","id":"405856829","characters":["Jim"]},{"name":"Daniel Kaluuya","id":"770911249","characters":["Mo"]},{"name":"Hannah Murray","id":"770809069","characters":["Emily"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Hideo Nakata"}],"alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1319704"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1319704","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/chatroom_2010/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771048661/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771048661/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771048661/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771048661.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
