The choir has always known how to sing in harmony, but the discord between its two leading ladies now threatens to tear them apart. Their newly appointed director, Vi Rose Hill (Latifah), stubbornly wants to stick with their tried-and-true traditional style, while the fiery G.G. Sparrow (Parton) thinks tried-and-true translates to tired-and-old. Shaking things up even more is the arrival of G.G.'s rebellious grandson, Randy (Jeremy Jordan). Randy has an ear for music, but he also has an eye for Vi Rose's beautiful and talented daughter, Olivia (Keke Palmer), and the sparks between the two teenagers are causing even more heat between G.G. and Vi Rose. -- (C) Official Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/D5x7ZC9KkqQKeemY88n5F98b34I=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/43/11164340_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/D5x7ZC9KkqQKeemY88n5F98b34I=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/43/11164340_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/D5x7ZC9KkqQKeemY88n5F98b34I=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/43/11164340_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/D5x7ZC9KkqQKeemY88n5F98b34I=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/43/11164340_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Queen Latifah","id":"162667338","characters":["Vi Rose Hill"]},{"name":"Dolly Parton","id":"162664108","characters":["G.G.
