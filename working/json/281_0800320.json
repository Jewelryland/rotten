Discovered at sea as an infant by a weary fisherman, demigod Perseus (Sam Worthington) grows up with no real knowledge of his celestial origins until his watchful guardian, Io (Gemma Arterton), informs him that he is the offspring of Zeus (Liam Neeson). When Zeus' brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes) casually wipes out Perseus' family, the grieving son vows to show the gods just what kind of damage humankind can inflict on its creators. Before long, Perseus and a small group of soldiers are venturing out into the desert in order to find a way to stop the Kraken, a terrifying force of nature that an indignant Hades has vowed to unleash upon man should they fail to offer up beloved princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) as a sacrifice. Along the way, the soldiers encounter a trio of frightening witches with second sight, contend with Hades' devoted servant Calibos (Jason Flemyng), battle giant scorpions, and come face to face with Medusa (Natalia Vodianova), the dreaded gorgon whose gaze has the power to turn men into stone. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/vNintWd14aDzAbOw1eZOQu5LHhw=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/71/11167122_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/vNintWd14aDzAbOw1eZOQu5LHhw=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/71/11167122_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/vNintWd14aDzAbOw1eZOQu5LHhw=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/71/11167122_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/vNintWd14aDzAbOw1eZOQu5LHhw=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/71/11167122_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Sam Worthington","id":"326396777","characters":["Perseus"]},{"name":"Ralph Fiennes","id":"162653681","characters":["Hades"]},{"name":"Liam Neeson","id":"162652242","characters":["Zeus"]},{"name":"Jason Flemyng","id":"162662243","characters":["Calibos/Acrisius"]},{"name":"Gemma Arterton","id":"770692644","characters":["Io"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Louis Leterrier"}],"studio":"Warner Bros.","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"0800320"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=0800320","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/clash_of_the_titans_2010/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770805266/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770805266/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770805266/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770805266.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
