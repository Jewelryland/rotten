Each is obsessed with his separate mission, and guided by the wisdom of The Bartender (Woody Harrelson) at the Horseless Horseman Saloon, the two eventually join forces to bring down the corrupt and contemptuous reign of Nicola (Ron Perlman), the awesomely evil \"woodcutter\" and his lady Alexandra (Demi Moore), a femme fatale with a secret past. This classic tale is re-vitalized and re-imagined in an entirely fresh visual context, set in a unique world that mixes skewed reality with shadow-play fantasy, a place where even the landscape can betray you. -- (C) Picturesque Films","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/8ZqBtcmLS2rGLc3pQFBQacTMyLg=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/93/11159303_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/8ZqBtcmLS2rGLc3pQFBQacTMyLg=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/93/11159303_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/8ZqBtcmLS2rGLc3pQFBQacTMyLg=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/93/11159303_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/8ZqBtcmLS2rGLc3pQFBQacTMyLg=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/93/11159303_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Josh Hartnett","id":"162666766","characters":["The Drifter"]},{"name":"Woody Harrelson","id":"162654250","characters":["Bartender"]},{"name":"Gackt Camui","id":"374852652","characters":["Yoshi"]},{"name":"Kevin Mckidd","id":"162720728","characters":["Killer No. 2"]},{"name":"Jordi Molla","id":"364617086","characters":["Valentine"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Guy Moshe"}],"studio":"Cinedigm Entertainment","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1181795"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1181795","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bunraku/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770785560/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770785560/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770785560/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770785560.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
