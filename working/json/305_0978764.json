Unrestrained by the boundaries of time and place, she is free to go where her mind takes her, and her incredible adventures blur the lines between what's real and what is imaginary. She has been locked away against her will, but Babydoll (Emily Browning) has not lost her will to survive. Determined to fight for her freedom, she urges four other young girls-the reluctant Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), the outspoken Rocket (Jena Malone), the street-smart Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) and the fiercely loyal Amber (Jamie Chung)-to band together and try to escape a terrible fate at the hands of their captors, Blue (Oscar Isaac) and Madam Gorski (Carla Gugino), before the mysterious High Roller (Jon Hamm) comes for Babydoll. Led by Babydoll, the girls engage in fantastical warfare against everything from samurais to serpents, with a virtual arsenal at their disposal. Together, they must decide what they are willing to sacrifice in order to stay alive. But with the help of a Wise Man (Scott Glenn), their unbelievable journey-if they succeed-will set them free.. -- (C) Warner Bros","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Kcvz61Lwz_8hyMYE8MzfFICyR0o=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/67/11166716_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Kcvz61Lwz_8hyMYE8MzfFICyR0o=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/67/11166716_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Kcvz61Lwz_8hyMYE8MzfFICyR0o=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/67/11166716_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/Kcvz61Lwz_8hyMYE8MzfFICyR0o=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/67/11166716_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Emily Browning","id":"381421024","characters":["Babydoll"]},{"name":"Abbie Cornish","id":"286584167","characters":["Sweet Pea"]},{"name":"Jena Malone","id":"162655292","characters":["Rocket"]},{"name":"Vanessa Hudgens","id":"171852649","characters":["Blondie"]},{"name":"Jamie Chung","id":"770694653","characters":["Amber"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Zack Snyder"}],"studio":"IMAX","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"0978764"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=0978764","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sucker-punch-2010/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770805422/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770805422/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770805422/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770805422.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
