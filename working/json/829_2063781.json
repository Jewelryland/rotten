When Kate&#700;s drinking leads her to dangerous places and her job as a school teacher is put into jeopardy, she decides to join AA and get sober. With the help of her friend and sponsor Jenny, and the vice principal at her school, the awkward, but well intentioned, Mr. Davies, Kate takes steps toward improving her health and life. Sobriety isn&#700;t as easy as Kate had anticipated. Her new lifestyle brings to the surface a troubling relationship with her mother, facing the lies she&#700;s told her employer and calls into question whether or not her relationship with Charlie is built on love or is just boozy diversion from adulthood. -- (C) Sony","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/ER4OVM5R4twjHtmqDs2CK4FnfZ4=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/67/11166760_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/ER4OVM5R4twjHtmqDs2CK4FnfZ4=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/67/11166760_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/ER4OVM5R4twjHtmqDs2CK4FnfZ4=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/67/11166760_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/ER4OVM5R4twjHtmqDs2CK4FnfZ4=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/67/11166760_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Mary Elizabeth Winstead","id":"341817661","characters":["Kate Hannah"]},{"name":"Aaron Paul","id":"410145522","characters":["Charlie Hannah"]},{"name":"Octavia Spencer","id":"770689255","characters":["Jenny"]},{"name":"Nick Offerman","id":"770669630","characters":["Mr. Davies"]},{"name":"Megan Mullally","id":"162652805","characters":["Principal Barnes"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"James Ponsoldt"},{"name":"James&#160;ponsoldt"}],"studio":"Sony Pictures Classics","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"2063781"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=2063781","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/smashed/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771266233/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771266233/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771266233/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771266233.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
