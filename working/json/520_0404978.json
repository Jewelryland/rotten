A British thief (Firth) discovers that no plan is infallible when he recruits a beautiful woman (Diaz) to help him steal a priceless statue from an impossibly wealthy widower (Alan Rickman). Despite the fact that his pretty accomplice bears an uncanny resemblance to his affluent target's late wife, things quickly spin out of control once the job gets under way. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/YtPVcOJHkClVohsexPEMyKpMt4M=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/06/11190662_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/YtPVcOJHkClVohsexPEMyKpMt4M=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/06/11190662_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/YtPVcOJHkClVohsexPEMyKpMt4M=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/06/11190662_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/YtPVcOJHkClVohsexPEMyKpMt4M=/54x77/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/19/06/11190662_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Colin Firth","id":"162654659","characters":["Harry Deane"]},{"name":"Cameron Diaz","id":"162654443","characters":["PJ Puznowski"]},{"name":"Alan Rickman","id":"162666132","characters":["Lionel Shabander"]},{"name":"Tom Courtenay","id":"162674631","characters":["The Major"]},{"name":"Stanley Tucci","id":"162661152","characters":["Zaidenweber"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Michael Hoffman"}],"studio":"CBS Films","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"0404978"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=0404978","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gambit_2014/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771237501/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771237501/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771237501/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771237501.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
