For Dane the only exciting thing about their new town is the beautiful girl next door, Julie. With Susan spending more and more time at work, Dane and Lucas are left unattended to explore the depths of their eerie new residence. But then everything changes when they find a sinister black hole under a locked trap door in the basement. Hoping for some answers about the house's past, Dane and Lucas bring Julie in on their new discovery. When the hole is exposed, evil is unleashed. With strange shadows lurking around every corner and past nightmares coming to life, the trio will have to come face to face with their darkest fears to put an end to The Hole. -- (C) Official Site","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/dlahx4SOZI7eFhrKRQbQjRnCLtI=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/69/11166947_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/dlahx4SOZI7eFhrKRQbQjRnCLtI=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/69/11166947_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/dlahx4SOZI7eFhrKRQbQjRnCLtI=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/69/11166947_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/dlahx4SOZI7eFhrKRQbQjRnCLtI=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/16/69/11166947_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Chris Massoglia","id":"770837049","characters":["Dane Thompson"]},{"name":"Haley Bennett","id":"770768361","characters":["Julie Campbell"]},{"name":"Nathan Gamble","id":"770682696","characters":["Lucas Thompson"]},{"name":"Teri Polo","id":"162659376","characters":["Susan Thompson"]},{"name":"Bruce Dern","id":"162658850","characters":["Creepy Carl"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Joe Dante"}],"studio":"Hole LLC.","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1085779"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1085779","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10011815-hole/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770813886/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770813886/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770813886/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/770813886.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
