But when his two best friends Casey and Miller surprise him with a visit for his 21st birthday, Jeff Chang decides to do everything he wants to do for a change, even though his important medical school interview is early the next morning. What was supposed to be one beer becomes a night of humiliation, over indulgence and utter debauchery in this coming-of-drinking-age-comedy, from the writers of THE HANGOVER, about living youth to its fullest.","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/RgsXLBJHB2lzStnMKQB4XDKMZ-Q=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/21/11172177_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/RgsXLBJHB2lzStnMKQB4XDKMZ-Q=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/21/11172177_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/RgsXLBJHB2lzStnMKQB4XDKMZ-Q=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/21/11172177_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/RgsXLBJHB2lzStnMKQB4XDKMZ-Q=/54x81/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/17/21/11172177_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Miles Teller","id":"771077409","characters":["Miller"]},{"name":"Skylar Astin","id":"770797712","characters":["Casey"]},{"name":"Justin Chon","id":"422942992","characters":["Jeff Chang"]},{"name":"Sarah Wright","id":"770806988","characters":["Nicole"]},{"name":"Jonathan Keltz","id":"554971226","characters":["Randy"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Scott Moore"},{"name":"Jon Lucas"}],"studio":"Relativity Media","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1711425"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1711425","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/21_and_over/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771304584/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771304584/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771304584/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771304584.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
