Tapped by The Observer to review fine restaurants throughout the Lake District and Yorkshire Dales, Steve finds himself without a traveling companion after his girlfriend decides not to go at the last minute. After being turned down by everyone else he knows, Steve extends an invitation to Rob, and together the pair attempt to navigate the winding back roads of rural England, impersonating popular celebrities such as Michael Caine, Woody Allen and Liam Neeson (among many others) and bickering along the way. -- (C) IFC","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/jq5ULwHoOigC-swo0nkBD1MMamQ=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/73/11157369_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/jq5ULwHoOigC-swo0nkBD1MMamQ=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/73/11157369_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/jq5ULwHoOigC-swo0nkBD1MMamQ=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/73/11157369_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/jq5ULwHoOigC-swo0nkBD1MMamQ=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/73/11157369_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Steve Coogan","id":"162671833","characters":["Steve"]},{"name":"Margo Stilley","id":"364626901","characters":["Mischa"]},{"name":"Rob Brydon","id":"162654375","characters":["Rob"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Michael Winterbottom"}],"studio":"IFC Films","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1740047"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1740047","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_trip_2011/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771230353/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771230353/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771230353/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771230353.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
