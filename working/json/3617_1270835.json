Crowley has murdered Marybeth's family and other fellow vacationers who had come together on a tourist excursion in the swamp lands outside of New Orleans. <br /><br /> Marybeth escapes from Crowley and manages to make it back to civilization, where she once again encounters voodoo shop proprietor Reverend Zombie (Tony Todd), who had helped to arrange Marybeth and company's earlier, ill-fated tour of the area. To help Marybeth and also serve his own secret agenda, Reverend Zombie recruits a hardened pack of hunters to head back into the swamp to seek revenge on Victor Crowley.-- (C) Dark Sky Films","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://resizing.flixster.com/-FQOPOwiQfCmndgPz4MNKTN7o18=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/30/11153069_ori.jpg","profile":"http://resizing.flixster.com/-FQOPOwiQfCmndgPz4MNKTN7o18=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/30/11153069_ori.jpg","detailed":"http://resizing.flixster.com/-FQOPOwiQfCmndgPz4MNKTN7o18=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/30/11153069_ori.jpg","original":"http://resizing.flixster.com/-FQOPOwiQfCmndgPz4MNKTN7o18=/54x80/dkpu1ddg7pbsk.cloudfront.net/movie/11/15/30/11153069_ori.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Kane Hodder","id":"162685318","characters":["Victor Crowley"]},{"name":"Danielle Harris","id":"460712829","characters":["Marybeth"]},{"name":"Tony Todd","id":"162685869","characters":["Reverend Zombie"]},{"name":"Parry Shen","id":"162707417","characters":["Justin"]},{"name":"Todd Holland","id":"162677327"}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Adam Green"}],"studio":"Dark Sky Films","alternate_ids":{"imdb":"1270835"},"links":{"self":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id=1270835","alternate":"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hatchet_ii/","cast":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771203994/cast.json","reviews":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771203994/reviews.json","similar":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771203994/similar.json","canonical":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movies/771203994.json"},"link_template":"http://api.rottentomatoes.com/api/public/v1.0/movie_alias.json?type=imdb&id={alias-id}"}
